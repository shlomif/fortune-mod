/* Modified September, 1995, Amy A. Lewis
 * 1: removed all file-locking dreck.  Unnecessary
 * 2: Fixed bug that made fortune -f report a different list than
 *    fortune with any other parameters, or none, and which forced
 *    the program to read only one file (named 'fortunes')
 * 3: removed the unnecessary print_file_list()
 * 4: Added "OFFDIR" to pathnames.h as the directory in which offensive
 *    fortunes are kept.  This considerably simplifies our life by
 *    permitting us to dispense with a lot of silly tests for the string
 *    "-o" at the end of a filename.
 * 5: I think the problems with trying to find filenames were fixed by
 *    the change in the way that offensive files are defined.  Two birds,
 *    one stone!
 * 6: Calculated probabilities for all files, so that -f will print them.

/* Modified May 1997, Dennis L. Clark (dbugger@progsoc.uts.edu.au)
 *  + Various portability fixes
 *  + Percent selection of files with -a now works on datafiles which
 *    appear in both unoffensive and offensive directories (see man page
 *    for details)
 *  + The -s and -l options are now more consistent in their
 *    interpretation of fortune length
 *  + The -s and -l options can now be combined wit the -m option
 */

/* Modified Jul 1999, Pablo Saratxaga <srtxg@chanae.alphanet.ch>
 * - added use of the LANG variables; now if called without argument
 * it will choose (if they exist) fortunes in the users' language.
 * (that is, under a directory $LANG/ under the main fortunes directory
 *
 * Added to debian by Alastair McKinstry, <mckinstry@computer.org>, 2002-07-31
