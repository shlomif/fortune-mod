.SH "NAME"
strfile \- create a random access file for storing strings
.br
unstr \- dump strings in pointer order

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBstrfile\fR\ 'u

  \fBstrfile\fR     [\-iorsx]
     [\-c\ \fIchar\fR]
     \fIsourcefile\fR
     [\fIoutputfile\fR]

.HP \w'\fBunstr\fR\ 'u

  \fBunstr\fR     [\-c\ \fIchar\fR]
     \fIdatafile\&.[ext]\fR
     [\fIoutputfile\fR]




.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBstrfile\fR
reads a file containing groups of lines separated by a line containing a single percent `%\*(Aq sign (or other specified delimiter character) and creates a data file which contains a header structure and a table of file offsets for each group of lines\&. This allows random access of the strings\&.

.PP
The output file, if not specified on the command line, is named
\fIsourcefile\&.dat\fR\&.

.PP
The purpose of
\fBunstr\fR
is to undo the work of
\fBstrfile\fR\&. It prints out the strings contained in the sourcefile, which is
\fIdatafile\&.ext\fR
without its extension, or
\fIdatafile\fR
if no extension is specified (in this case, the extension
\fB\&.dat\fR
is added to the name of the datafile) in the order that they are listed in the header file
\fIdatafile\fR\&. If no
\fIoutputfile\fR
is specified, it prints to standard output; otherwise it prints to the file specified\&.
\fBunstr\fR
can also universally change the delimiter character in a strings file\&. It is possible to create sorted versions of input files by using
\fBstrfile \-o\fR
and then using
\fBunstr\fR
to dump them out in the table order\&.

.SS "Options"
.PP
The options are as follows:



  .PP
\fB\-c \fR\fIchar\fR
.RS 4

  
  
Change the delimiting character from the percent sign to
\fIchar\fR\&. This option is available for both
\fBstrfile\fR
and
\fBunstr\fR\&.

  
  .RE
  .PP
\fB\-i\fR
.RS 4

  
  
Ignore case when ordering the strings\&.

  
  .RE
  .PP
\fB\-o\fR
.RS 4

  
  
Order the strings in alphabetical order\&. The offset table will be sorted in the alphabetical order of the groups of lines referenced\&. Any initial non\-alphanumeric characters are ignored\&. This option causes the STR_ORDERED bit in the header
\fIstr_flags\fR
field to be set\&. (It also now really does sort! It didn\*(Aqt used to)\&.

  
  .RE
  .PP
\fB\-r\fR
.RS 4

  
  
Randomize access to the strings\&. Entries in the offset table will be randomly ordered\&. This option causes the STR_RANDOM bit in the header
\fIstr_flags\fR
field to be set\&. (And really does randomize)

  
  .RE
  .PP
\fB\-s\fR
.RS 4

  
  
Run silently; don\*(Aqt give a summary message when finished\&.

  
  .RE
  .PP
\fB\-x\fR
.RS 4

  
  
Note that each alphabetic character in the groups of lines is rotated 13 positions in a simple caesar cypher\&. This option causes the STR_ROTATED bit in the header
\fIstr_flags\fR
field to be set\&. Note that it
\fBdoes not\fR
rotate the strings\-\-that operation must be performed separately\&.

  
  .RE


.SS "Header"
.PP
The format of the header is:

.PP
#define VERSION 1
unsigned long str_version; /* version number */
unsigned long str_numstr; /* # of strings in the file */
unsigned long str_longlen; /* length of longest string */
unsigned long str_shortlen; /* shortest string length */
#define STR_RANDOM 0x1 /* randomized pointers */
#define STR_ORDERED 0x2 /* ordered pointers */
#define STR_ROTATED 0x4 /* rot\-13\*(Aqd text */
unsigned long str_flags; /* bit field for flags */
char str_delim; /* delimiting character */

.PP
All fields are written in network byte order\&.



.SH "BUGS"
.PP
Fewer now, one hopes\&. However, fortunes (text strings) beginning with a blank line appear to be sorted between random letters\&. This includes ASCII art that contains no letters, and first lines that are solely non\-alphanumeric, apparently\&. I\*(Aqve no idea why this should be\&.


.SH "OTHER USES"
.PP
What can you do with this besides printing sarcastic and obscene messages to the screens of lusers at login or logout?

.PP
There
\fBare\fR
some other possibilities\&. Source code for a sample program,
\fBrandstr\fR, is included with this distribution: randstr splits the difference between
\fBunstr\fR
and
\fBfortune\fR\&. It reads a single, specified file, and randomly selects a single text string\&.



  .PP
1
.RS 4

  
  
Include
\fIstrfile\&.h\fR
into a news reading/posting program, to generate random signatures\&.
\fBTin\fR(1)
does something similar, in a much more complex manner\&.

  
  .RE
  .PP
2
.RS 4

  
  
Include it in a game\&. While strfile doesn\*(Aqt support \*(Aqfields\*(Aq or \*(Aqrecords\*(Aq, there\*(Aqs no reason that the text strings can\*(Aqt be consistent: first line, a die roll; second line, a score; third and subsequent lines, a text message\&.

  
  .RE
  .PP
3
.RS 4

  
  
Use it to store your address book\&. Hell, some of the guys I know would be as well off using it to decide who to call on Friday nights (and for some, it wouldn\*(Aqt matter whether there were phone numbers in it or not)\&.

  
  .RE
  .PP
4
.RS 4

  
  
Use it in \*(Aqlottery\*(Aq situations\&. If you\*(Aqre an ISP, write a script to store login names and GECOS from
/etc/passwd
in strfile format, write another to send \*(Aqcongratulations, you\*(Aqve won\*(Aq to the lucky login selected\&. The prize might be a month\*(Aqs free service, or if you\*(Aqre AOL, a month free on a real service provider\&.

.SH "HISTORY"
.PP
The
\fBstrfile\fR
utility first appeared in 4\&.4BSD\&. This version was heavily modified, much of it in ways peculiar to Linux\&. Work has since been done to make the code more generic, and has so far been tested to work with SunOS 4\&.x\&. More platforms are expected to be supported as work continues\&.
