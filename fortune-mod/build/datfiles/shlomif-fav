Personally, I'd have a far better time writing scripts if I had some more
creative shells to script in…

ASMsh: The Assembly shell. Commands include MOV, SHL, SHR, JNE, etc.

shellTM: Turing machine shell. Only four commands. Read, write, move left,
move right. Capable of producing any programming language imaginable, given
enough time and nerves of steel.

GeneSH: Four commands. G, A, T, C. Need I say more?

Qsh: Only uses one environment variable, which contains all possible values
simultaneously. Method of scripting: isolate the universe in which the desired
result is already accomplished, and intersect with it.

Of course, I never said they'd be easy to use. But then, if these shells
existed, and I knew a sysadmin who used any of them, you can believe Sysadmin
Day would be a far more celebrated holiday.

The dictionary definition of capitalism is: An economic system characterized
by private ownership of capital goods and by investments that are determined
by private decision rather than by state control. Prices, production and
distribution of goods are determined by a free market.

…

But most writers and commentators put dishonest altruistic-platonistic
connotations on the meaning of capitalism: A system of exploitation of the
weak by the strong -- devoid of love and good will. A system in which unwanted
goods and services are pushed onto consumers through clever, deceptive
advertising for the sole purpose of profits and greed. Capitalism dominates
most Western governments. Capitalism, big business, and fascism are
synonymous.

Yet, acting on fully integrated honesty (Neo-Tech), not reason itself, is the
basic moral act. When Genghis Khan, for example, chose to use reasoning for a
specific military move, then in an out-of-context sense, he chose to act
morally by protecting himself and his troops (thus filling human biological
needs). But in the larger sense of fully integrated honesty, Khan's total
actions were grossly immoral in choosing to use aggressive force in becoming a
mass murderer (thus negating human biological needs). The highly destructive,
irrational immorality of Genghis Khan's overall dictatorial military actions
far outweighed any narrow, out-of-context "moral" actions. …Genghis Khan was
enormously evil as were Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Castro, Pol Pot.

Why are there so many unmaintainable applications written in PHP and Perl?
Because PHP and Perl let undisciplined, inexperienced programmers write useful
code. So does Ruby -- but give it the popularity and longevity of PHP and Perl
(at least in English-speaking circles) and I bet you'll see plenty of bad code
written in Ruby too.

This seems like a variant of the Hackers and Painters fallacy. (Paul Graham is
rich. Paul Graham writes Lisp. Therefore everyone who writes Lisp will get
rich.) "All of the good, smart programmers I know are using Ruby. They write
good code. Therefore you can't write bad code in Ruby!"

It feels like there's another fallacy in there somewhere. I want to call it
the Pre-Post-Java Blindspot, where Java was the beginning of Serious
Programming Languages and only its successor will unseat it. (Like any good
fallacy, you have to ignore history, such as the fact that Ruby's between 10
and 12 years old.)

You could start a twelve-step program or something.)

Much of the relative simplicity of Java is - like for most new languages -
partly an illusion and partly a function of its incompleteness. As time
passes, Java will grow significantly in size and complexity. It will double or
triple in size and grow implementation-dependent extensions or libraries. That
is the way every commercially successful language has developed. Just look at
any language you consider successful on a large scale. I know of no
exceptions, and there are good reasons for this phenomenon. [I wrote this

Although the contents of her book, The Virtue of Selfishness, are precisely
accurate and widely integrated, Ayn Rand committed an error by distorting the
word "selfishness" in fashioning a dramatic statement. The word "selfishness"
does have valuable, precise denotations of "an irrational, harmful disregard
for others". Rand could have strengthened her work by selecting accurate
wording such as rational self-growth. Instead, she unnecessarily bent and
undermined the precise, valuable meaning of selfishness. …As with
selflessness, selfishness is a form of immature, destructive, irrational
behavior -- a form of stupid behavior.

Extra Peculiar

Did you watch Uri Geller's show last night? He said that if anything
extraordinary happened at home during the show, people should phone in, or
report it at his website. During the entire show I was installing Hebrew
Windows XP for my mother-in-law, and something extraordinary did happen. The
operating system got installed, came up, ran without a glitch. Should I report
this to Uri?

khatul's comment:

Without a glitch, huh? Apparently you (and Uri) managed to install Linux from
a Windows XP installation CD. This is much more than telekinesis. It smells
like pure alien intervention. Report immediately!

It's one of those rare "perfect" kernels. So if it doesn't happen to compile
with your config (or it does compile, but then does unspeakable acts of
perversion with your pet dachshund), you can rest easy knowing that it's all
your own d*mn fault, and you should just fix your evil ways.

You could send me and the kernel mailing list a note about it anyway, of
course. (And perhaps pictures, if your dachshund is involved. Not that we'd be
interested, of course. No. Just so that we'd know to avoid it next time).

In a widely anticipated move, Linux "headcase" Torvalds today announced the
immediate availability of the most advanced Linux kernel to date, version
2.6.20.

Before downloading the actual new kernel, most avid kernel hackers have been
involved in a 2-hour pre-kernel-compilation count-down, with some even
spending the preceding week doing typing exercises and reciting PI to a
thousand decimal places.

The half-time entertainment is provided by randomly inserted trivial syntax
errors that nerds are expected to fix at home before completing the compile,
but most people actually seem to mostly enjoy watching the compile warnings,
sponsored by Anheuser-Busch, scroll past.

As ICD head analyst Walter Dickweed put it: "Releasing a new kernel on
Superbowl Sunday means that the important 'pasty white nerd' constituency
finally has something to do while the rest of the country sits comatose in
front of their 65" plasma screens".

Walter was immediately attacked for his racist and insensitive remarks by
Geeks without Borders representative Marilyn vos Savant, who pointed out that
not all of their members are either pasty nor white. "Some of them even
shower!" she added, claiming that the constant stereotyping hurts nerds'
standing in society.

Geeks outside the US were just confused about the whole issue, and were heard
wondering what the big hoopla was all about. Some of the more culturally aware
of them were heard snickering about balls that weren't even round.

Slashdot Comment on Reasons to or not to use MySQL:

A nice flame war. I'm just going to sit back, crack a beer and enjoy it. It is
almost memorial day weekend, you know. Hopefully it get hot enough in here to
roast a hot dog.

Oh goody! I'll help get things going:

* * MySQL users will have to wait until you are done with the fire before they
can roast their hot dogs, since MySQL is not a real database and does not
support concurrent roasting;

* * I've read the PostgreSQL manual eight times and still can't figure out
something as bloody simple as roasting a hot dog, though I did figure out I
have to call VACUUM before I can apply ketchup;

* * Serious enterprises who care about their hot dogs use Oracle, since you
can roast over 10,000 dogs at once and optionally impart the taste of filet
mignon;

* * If you try to roast a footlong hotdog using MySQL it will silently
truncate it to regular size, causing your child to cry;

* * Oracle will sue you if you complain about the difficulty of starting your
fire or the blackened taste of the dogs;

* * With SQLite your hot dogs are pre-roasted;

* * Last year on Memorial Day, mysqld leapt out of my MacBook Pro and pushed
my cousin into the fire, resulting in third degree burns. And also it causes
cancer. And terrorism. Blindness. Violent puppy death. BOO! MYSQL IS SCARY

Poetical sing-song or hypnotically rhythmic meter are often found in the
rhetoric of dictators, evangelists, sibyls, politicians, theologians,
mountebanks, social "intellectuals", media men, medicine men, hallucinating
psychotics, chanting shiites, and screaming terrorists. Consider how millions
of normally rational Germans thrilled and responded to the poetical cadence
and charisma of the consummate altruist neocheater, Adolph Hitler. The
results: a reign of destruction with tens of millions of human beings
slaughtered so one impotent man could indulge his mysticism to feel unearned
power. All that slaughter was for nothing more than to let one neocheater feel
a pseudo self-esteem. …Twenty million dead so one pip-squeak could feel big
and important.

"So what!" cry the mystics as the lifetime efforts of a thousand productive,
innocent individuals are blown to bits every day without a backward glance. So
what if the troops roll across the country with military cadence and guns
ablaze. So what if they level town after town, reducing to rubble and corpses
all the values, beauty, and life that took generations of productive effort to
build.

And that is all the chanting religious automatons or splendid Panzer divisions
know how to do -- to destroy in a moment, without a thought, all the values
that producers labored for lifetimes to build. Chanting mobs or marching
troops never glance back, never think for a moment of the death and
destruction they leave behind. So what! the mystics and neocheaters cry. So
what if genocide happens in Russia, Nazi Germany, Cuba, Cambodia, Red China,
or in our land. "I don't want to hear it! To hell with the lifetime efforts of
productive individuals! …Save the snail darter!"

What *would* Jesus do?

"They felt Jesus would not have approved of copyright breaches."

Jesus, you da man! Stick it to those kids!

You might be interested to note that the students had studied "Exodus 20:15 -
you shall not steal" which comes a little way before Jesus anyway. Wasn't the
whole point of Jesus coming to make the "new commandment" that people "love
one another as I have loved you" and to annul the previous commandments that
were given to Moses? I was raised Christian and was Christian for a long time
but now am not, but I can't quite remember the specifics of this point.

Anyway, the point is that Jesus probably would have told them to stick Exodus
to the man and just get on with the lovin'. Or something.

Apart from the fact that I congratulate you for writing bugless software
without peer review, I also congratulate you for being able to write a fully
RFC compliant MLM that won't blow up when you receive input you didn't account
for.

Quite frankly, even a crappy sysadmin can get a reasonable mailman setup
working (including nice archiving), quicker than the best coder can rewrite a
full MLM from scratch. And you still have time left over to modify/fix/improve
mailman to do the few things it didn't do quite right for you.

But if your attitude to coding is "I'd rather rewrite all this than soiling my
eyes and hands looking at someone else's code", that's not a very good way to
get hired anywhere as a coder, and even if you are super brilliant, you end up
being a DJB that people snicker at with "that guy thinks he's so bright that
he had to write his own libc" (instead of fixing/wrapping the few problematic
pieces of them, and in the case of reasonable maintainers, contributing the
code back).

Among the generalists, the conventional wisdom is that the worse-is-better
approach is more adaptive. Personally, I get a little tired of the argument:
My worse-is-better is better than your worse-is-better because I'm better at
being worser! Is it really true that the worse-is-better approach always wins?
With Perl 6 we're trying to sneak one better-is-better cycle in there and hope
to come out ahead before reverting to the tried and true worse-is-better
approach. Whether that works, only time will tell.

Are you saying that this linux can run on a computer without windows
underneath it, at all ? As in, without a boot disk, without any drivers, and
without any services ?

That sounds preposterous to me.

If it were true (and I doubt it), then companies would be selling computers
without a windows. This clearly is not happening, so there must be some error
in your calculations. I hope you realise that windows is more than just Office
? Its a whole system that runs the computer from start to finish, and that is
a very difficult thing to acheive. A lot of people dont realise this.

Microsoft just spent $9 billion and many years to create Vista, so it does not
sound reasonable that some new alternative could just snap into existence
overnight like that. It would take billions of dollars and a massive effort to
achieve. IBM tried, and spent a huge amount of money developing OS/2 but could
never keep up with Windows. Apple tried to create their own system for years,
but finally gave up recently and moved to Intel and Microsoft.

Its just not possible that a freeware like the Linux could be extended to the
point where it runs the entire computer fron start to finish, without using
some of the more critical parts of windows. Not possible.

I think you need to re-examine your assumptions.

Linux Genuine Advantage™ is an exciting and mandatory new way for you to place
your computer under the remote control of an untrusted third party!

According to an independent study conducted by some scientists, many users of
Linux are running non-Genuine versions of their operating system. This puts
them at the disadvantage of having their computers work normally, without
periodically phoning home unannounced to see if it's OK for their computer to
continue functioning. These users are also missing out on the Advantage of
paying ongoing licensing fees to ensure their computer keeps operating
properly.

To remedy this, we have created a new program available as a required free
download: Linux Genuine Advantage™!

Finally! Linux users can experience a feature that until now remained the
exclusive domain of proprietary software.

Once you've installed Linux Genuine Advantage™, you'll want to register and
send in your licensing fees to receive these important benefits:

* Your computer, which worked just fine before, will continue functioning
normally!

* Our software which you just installed will not disable logins on your
computer (as long as our license server keeps working properly)!

* It's totally awesome! We might not raise the yearly licensing fees in the
future!

Plus, if you act now, we promise not to launch unfounded lawsuits against you,
slander you or our competitors in the press and the courts (possibly by using
other smaller companies as pawns), or require you to pay us for software you
won't use on every new computer you buy!

programmers onto other tasks, like improving Vista!

So I'd like to start off with my own irrationalities.

I don't think syntax should dangle in the wind. I'm with Aristotle. I think
things should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Which means I like K&R
bracketing. I do not like the way that Python hangs stuff out there, with no
end.

I think that ordinary people dislike abstraction. That's because I dislike
abstraction and I think I'm ordinary. (laughter) I might be wrong about that,
but I don't know.

I simultaneously believe that languages are wonderful and awful. You have to
hold both of those. Ugly things can be beautiful. And beautiful can get ugly
very fast. You know, take Lisp. You know, it's the most beautiful language in
the world. At least up until Haskell came along. (laughter) But, you know,
every program in Lisp is just ugly. I don't figure how that works.

I think visual metaphors are very important. How it looks. Different things
should look different. Similar things should look similar. A language designer
simultaneously has to care what other people think, and has to not care what
other people think. Otherwise you go crazy. Well, crazier. (laughter)

And finally, I think God has free will. And therefore he created programmers
with free will and that they ought to be given choices.

    -- Larry Wall
    -- Present Continuous, Future Perfect (  )
%
Now, I'm not the only language designer with irrationalities. You can think of
some languages to go with some of these things.

* "We've got to start over from scratch" - Well, that's almost any academic
language you find.

* "English phrases" - Well that's Cobol. You know, cargo cult English.
(laughter)

* "Text processing doesn't matter much" - Fortran.

* "Simple languages produce simple solutions" - C.

* "If I wanted it fast, I'd write it in C" - That's almost a direct quote from
the original awk page.

* "I thought of a way to do it so it must be right" - That's obviously PHP.
(laughter and applause)

* "You can build anything with NAND gates" - Any language designed by an
electrical engineer. (laughter)

* "This is a very high level language, who cares about bits?" - The entire
scope of fourth generation languages fell into this… problem.

* "Users care about elegance" - A lot of languages from Europe tend to fall
into this. You know, Eiffel.

* "The specification is good enough" - Ada.

* "Abstraction equals usability" - Scheme. Things like that.

* "The common kernel should be as small as possible" - Forth.

* "Let's make this easy for the computer" - Lisp. (laughter)

* "Most programs are designed top-down" - Pascal. (laughter)

* "Everything is a vector" - APL.

* "Everything is an object" - Smalltalk and its children. (whispered:) Ruby.
(laughter)

* "Everything is a hypothesis" - Prolog. (laughter)

* "Everything is a function" - Haskell. (laughter)

* "Programmers should never have been given free will" - Obviously, Python.
(laughter)

So my psychological conjecture is that normal people, if they perceive that a
computer language is forcing them to learn theory, they won't like it. In
other words, hide the fancy stuff. It can be there, just hide it.

Back to dimensionality. When you are saying something linguistically, it's
like taking a trip. You know, when you take a trip from California to Netanya,
you don't go straight south and then straight west and then straight north.
It's not orthogonal. There are little bits at the beginning. Then you take
bigger hops on the planes and then you take littler hops at the end. Language
works the same way, it's fractal. There is little orthogonality. At least
apparently; you can have orthogonal views of it, there are orthogonal subsets.
But there are multiple orthogonal subsets. At first glance it just looks like
a network, and you have to navigate the geography.

Now in terms of the anthropology we try to welcome people into the tribe. We
allow people to have their own little fiefdoms, where they are the ruler and
can beat up on their followers.

We try to let people share with each other. We try to capture knowledge. Both
of those things are why we have the CPAN, Comprehensive Perl Archive Network,
which is arguably one of the greatest repositories of reusable crappy software
in the world. (laughter).

And we have a culture of cooperating with other cultures too. We try to make
Parrot so that other languages can ran on top of that. We've always tried to
hook up Perl with everything. In kind of a humble sort of way. And finally
it's culture of fun. At least we try to make it that way. And that's why I
give weird talks.

The difference between a program and a script isn't as subtle as most people
think. A script is interpreted, and a program is compiled.

Of course, there's no reason you can't write a compiler that immediately
executes the compiled form of a program without writing compilation artifacts
to disk, but that's an implementation detail, and precision in technical
matters is important.

Though Perl 5, for example, doesn't write out the artifacts of compilation to
disk and Java and .Net do, Perl 5 is clearly an interpreter even though it
evaluates the compiled form of code in the same way that the JVM and the CLR
do. Why? Because it's a scripting language.

Okay, that's a facetious explanation.

The difference between a program and a script is if there's native compilation
available in at least one widely-used implementation. Thus Java before the
prevalence of even the HotSpot JVM and its JIT was a scripting language and
now it's a programming language, except that you can write a C interpreter
that doesn't have a JIT and C programs become scripts.

    -- chromatic
    -- "Program vs. Script" ( http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/35804 )
%
Of course, if someone were to write an extra optimizer step for Perl 5 to
evaluate certain parts of the optree and generate native code in memory on
certain platforms without writing it out to disk (uh oh…) and then execute
that code under certain conditions, all Perl 5 scripts would automatically
turn into programs. You know, like .pmc files, or Python's .pyc files. Uh.

As well, if more people use Punie (Perl 1 on Parrot) this year than native
Perl 1 -- a possibility -- then Perl 1 scripts automatically become Perl 1
programs because Punie can use Parrot's JIT. I don't know if this powerful
upgrade from script to program is retroactive, but I see no reason why not.

Perl 5 scripts were briefly programs while Ponie was viable, but the removal
of the code from the Parrot tree has now downgraded them back to scripts. We
apologize for the inconvenience.

    -- chromatic
    -- "Program vs. Script" ( http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/35804 )
%
To summarize, if you have a separate compilation step visible to developers,
you have programs. If not, you have scripts. An exception is that if you have
a separate, partial compilation step at runtime and not visible to users, then
you may have programs. The presence of one implementation that performs
additional compilationy thingies at runtime instantly upgrades all scripts to
programs, while the presence of an interpreter for a language in which people
normally write programs, not scripts, does not downgrade programs to scripts.
Program-ness is sticky.

I hope this is now clear.

Ironically some JavaScript implementations have JITs, so the colloquial name
of the language should change from JavaScript to JavaProgram.

Script bad, four-legs good.

I have to say I cringed a little when I read it, because it helps reinforce
the idea that there's a sort of Perl Hierarchy, or that there are Perl gods,
or that "you must be this tall to ride".

Randal and I are just normal ol' Perl hackers. We just spend a lot of time on
Perl, and writing about it, and talking about it. The only reason we are Perl
luminaries is that we are Perl luminaries. I'm not necessarily a better
programmer, or have better ideas, or I'm a better debugger than anyone else. I
just do it and make noise about it.

Even though Joey's response was out of line, I admire his spirit of "I'm just
going to go do it." TMTOWTDI is one of the cardinal rules of Perl. Similarly,
over on the module-authors list, the perennial argument of "Maybe CPAN should
have minimum requirements for posting modules" has raised its ugly head.
Instead, I said what I always say during these arguments: "CPAN thrives
BECAUSE of the unfettered uploading of shit, not in spite of it."

So to it will be with Joey's website. Maybe it will be a dismal failure. Maybe
it will become the Next Great Perl resource. However, I know that there is
zero chance of Next Great Perl resource if he doesn't try. The only way you
get home runs is by stepping up to the plate, and if you strike out, you're
doing pretty good. Batting 3/10 is a great batting average, but in real life
we find those odds terrifying.

Personally, as much as I like the community around Perlmonks, I think it's a
terrible site for new people, and is practically unsearchable. I'd love to see
something leapfrog Perlmonks and become the Next Great Thing. That's why I
stopped writing to use.perl.org, because I think it's a terrible news source.
Instead, I started perlbuzz.com, and went with that. Yes, it's different, but
that's OK.

Suppose you went back to Ada Lovelace and asked her the difference between a
script and a program. She'd probably look at you funny, then say something
like: Well, a script is what you give the actors, but a program is what you
give the audience. That Ada was one sharp lady…

Now, however it was initially intended, I think BASIC turned out to be one of
the first major scripting languages, especially the extended version that DEC
put onto its minicomputers called BASIC/PLUS, which happily included recursive
functions with arguments. I started out as a BASIC programmer. Some people
would say that I'm permanently damaged. Some people are undoubtedly right.

But I'm not going to apologize for that. All language designers have their
occasional idiosyncrasies. I'm just better at it than most. :-)

Anyway, when I was a RSTS programmer on a PDP-11, I certainly treated BASIC as
a scripting language, at least in terms of rapid prototyping and process
control. I'm sure it warped my brain forever. Perl's statement modifiers are
straight out of BASIC/PLUS. It even had some cute sigils on the ends of its
variables to distinguish string and integer from floating point.

But you could do extreme programming. In fact, I had a college buddy I did
pair programming with. We took a compiler writing class together and studied
all that fancy stuff from the dragon book. Then of course the professor
announced we would be implementing our own language, called PL/0. After
thinking about it a while, we announced that we were going to do our project
in BASIC. The professor looked at us like were insane. Nobody else in the
class was using BASIC. And you know what? Nobody else in the class finished
their compiler either. We not only finished but added I/O extensions, and
called it PL 0.5. That's rapid prototyping.

My first scripting language was written in BASIC. For my job in the computer
center I wrote a language that I called JAM, short for Jury-rigged All-purpose
Meta-language. Story of my life…

JAM was an inside-out text-processing language much like PHP, except that HTML
hadn't been invented yet. We mostly used it as a fancy macro processor for
BASIC. Unlike PHP, it did not have 3,000 functions in one namespace. We
wouldn't have had the memory, for one thing.

For good or ill, when I went off to grad school, I studied linguistics, so the
only computer language I used there was LISP. It was my own personal McCarthy
era.

Is LISP a candidate for a scripting language? While you can certainly write
things rapidly in it, I cannot in good conscience call LISP a scripting
language. By policy, LISP has never really catered to mere mortals.

And, of course, mere mortals have never really forgiven LISP for not catering
to them.

I think, to most people, scripting is a lot like obscenity. I can't define it,
but I'll know it when I see it. Here are some common memes floating around:

<<<

Simple language
"Everything is a string"
Rapid prototyping
Glue language
Process control
Compact/concise
Worse-is-better
Domain specific
"Batteries included"

>>>

…I don't see any real center here, at least in terms of technology. If I had
to pick one metaphor, it'd be easy onramps. And a slow lane. Maybe even with
some optional fast lanes.

That's not helpful. When a project doesn't release a new version, some people
say "Oh, don't use it! They don't release new versions!" When a project does
release a new version, some people say "Oh, don't use it! It's not perfect
yet!"

Meanwhile, the so-called reliable state of the art is a jumble of Perl which
writes cross platform shell scripts to install Perl code, and you customize
that by writing a superclass from which platform-specific modules inherit
pseudo-methods which use regular expressions to search and replace
cross-platform cross-shell code, with all of the cross-platform and
cross-shell quoting issues that entails. I wish I were making any of this up.
(I wrote tests for part of it.)

This is why we can't have nice things.

I must dispute your view in the strongest terms possible. Internet Explorer is
perfectly safe for everyday use. However, as there is no such thing as perfect
security, you must take additional precautions to keep evil hackers away from
your data. Apply these rules according to the sensitivity of your data, from
least important to most:

* Disconnect your computer from your local network. Download files on another
computer, scan them for viruses, print them out, scan them into your Windows
PC using OCR software, and then view the pages in IE.

* Do the above, but have a priest onsite to bless each page individually
before scanning it. This is an excellent deterrent against viruses with the
word "demon" in the name.

* Do the above, but encase your PC in acrylic and immerse it in a 10,000
gallon tank of holy water. Interact with it while wearing scuba gear.

* Do the above, but put a lid on the tank and immerse it in the ocean.
Interact with your PC via a submersible robot in the tank from from outside
while wearing scuba gear.

If you fail to follow these simple security guidelines, you can't blame
Microsoft for the results.

The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to
structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony
in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and
rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of
structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes
structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into

Or think about shell programming, and reductionism. How many times have we
heard the mantra that a program should do one thing and do it well?

Well…Perl does one thing, and does it well. What it does well is to integrate
all its features into one language. More importantly, it does this without
making them all look like each other. Ducts shouldn't look like girders, and
girders shouldn't look like ducts. Neither of those should look like water
pipes, and it's really important that water pipes not look like sewer pipes.
Or smell like sewer pipes. Modernism says that we should make all these things
look the same (and preferably invisible). Postmodernism says it's okay for
them to stick out, and to look different, because a duct ought to look like a
duct, and a sewer pipe ought to look like a sewer pipe, and hammer ought to
look like a hammer, and a telephone ought to look like either a telephone, or
a Star Trek communicator. Things that are different should look different.

I keep hearing and reading this nice proverb *if it ain't broke, don't fix
it*. The latest appearance was in response to [Shlomi
Fish](http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/37969.html) suggesting
that some Ancient Perl code should be replaced by Modern Perl code.

I am not saying that every piece of code should be rewritten every 6 months,
but in my understanding that sentence actually translates to *let's wait till
it breaks and then panic*.

I think people who say that sentence are afraid that the new version will
break something. Sure, there is always a chance that a change introduces an
error, but, if we are afraid to touch the code, what will happen when later on
we encounter a case where it does not work? For example, if we need to use it
in a new environment. Will we have the courage to change the code then? How
much will it cost in money, time, and lost sleep?

I think we have been trying to teach ourselves that we should have really good
test coverage of our code and then we can easily refactor it and get rid of
technical debt. So why do we keep hearing that sentence?

Popular pet names Rover, Cheryl and Kate could be a thing of the past. Banks
are now advising parents to think carefully before naming their child’s first
pet. For security reasons, the chosen name should have at least eight
characters, a capital letter and a digit. It should not be the same as the
name of any previous pet, and must never be written down, especially on a
collar as that is the first place anyone would look. Ideally, children should
consider changing the name of their pet every 12 weeks.

Expectant mothers have also been advised to choose carefully where they give
birth. Anywhere that has a place name is best avoided. These are listed on
maps, which are freely available on the Internet.

It’s a good idea too, security experts have warned, for children not to get
friendly with certain teachers. For instance, Miss Smith may be enriching your
son’s education but he should try and see if he can’t make a favourite of
Father O’Grinnighan-Scythe II, even though it may mean a lot of staying late.

There are a ton of reasons why Debian may have an older version of an upstream
release. For example, and I hasten to point out that the following list is by
no means exhaustive, and not all of the possibilities are common:

* The Debian package maintainer is dead, but nobody noticed it yet, and nobody
has wanted an update badly enough to do an NMU or to adopt the package.

* The upstream release is actually a fake. It's a trojan, which was put there
by the NSA in order to infiltrate the CIA mainframe. The Debian package
maintainer noticed this and uploaded that version of the package to non-free
instead of main, since the trojan code does not come with proper source.

* Upstream has moved the RSS feed for new releases without notifying the old
feed of the move, so the Debian package maintainer missed that, and doesn't
actually know about the new release. Due to a complicated series of
happenstance involving rainbows, midget unicorns, and the ongoing rewrite of
the Netsurf web browser, the Debian package maintainer is not able to find the
new feed because it would require doing a web search and their browser doesn't
have working form support now. No other browser is available on the Amiga
they're using as their only computer, either.

* The new release is requested by insistent Hurd porters, and the Debian
package maintainer absolutely loathes the Hurd, and will refuse to upload any
packages that work on the Hurd.

* The Debian package maintainer suffers from mental problems cause by reading
debian-devel too much, and now has a nervous breakdown every time they
recognize a name as someone whom they've seen on the list.

* The Debian development process is being sabotaged by Microsoft sending
people to the developers' houses pretending to be TV license checkers or
Jehova's witnesses every time they detect, using the hardware wireless
keylogger embedded in every PC, that the developer is trying to run any Debian
packaging command.

* Apple is also sabotaging Debian by paying me to write snarky e-mails on
Debian mailing lists to distract everyone from working on the actual release,
so that we can get past the freeze and start uploading things again without
having to worry that it breaks things in ways that makes the freeze longer.

A contest is being held to see which intelligence agency can find a rabbit in
a forest as quickly as possible.

First, it's the CIA's turn. Using cutting edge satellite technology, deep
electronic scans, and other high-tech equipment, it is able to locate the
rabbit in a week.

Then, it's the KGB's turn. They install secret agents, bribe or threaten a few
animals, and find the rabbit in two weeks.

Then it's the [Shin Bet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet)’s turn (the
Shin Bet being the Israeli internal security agency). A week passes, and then
two, and then three.

After two months, the camera zooms into the forest to see a bear tied to a
tree with a Shin Bet agent slapping him saying “Admit you’re a rabbit! Admit
you’re a rabbit! Admit it already, goddamnit!”

I was lucky as Ricardo SIGNES was also awake who explained that actually he

[Dist::Zilla](http://metacpan.org/release/Dist-Zilla) that provides much
better project management capabilities. I pointed him at my blog entry and
after reading it he asked me if I know the expression *yak shaving* [=
performing a task which is required by a different task which is required by…
to achieve what one wants in the first place]. I've heard it, actually I even
read about it in in [The Productive
Programmer](http://productiveprogrammer.com/) I mentioned earlier in [The
Quest for the Perfect
Editor](http://szabgab.com/the-quest-for-the-perfect-editor.html) but I did
not really understand it.

Actually, I think I understood it back when I read the book but promptly
forgotten it as I did not have any way to connect the expression to the
actions or lack of actions.

I was so lucky to find Ricardo there, as he explained:

* I need to fix this bug, but first I better eat something so I don’t get
tired.

* So I'm going to have some cereal, but I'm out of milk.

* So I'll go get some milk. But I heard that yak milk is the best, so I'll go
out to Nepal to find a yak.

* But they're all so hairy, I can't get to their udders.

* So, first I'll just shave the yak.

At this point, I'd like to take a moment to speak to you about the Adobe PSD
format. PSD is not a good format. PSD is not even a bad format. Calling it
such would be an insult to other bad formats, such as PCX or JPEG. No, PSD is
an abysmal format. Having worked on this code for several weeks now, my hate
for PSD has grown to a raging fire that burns with the fierce passion of a
million suns.

If there are two different ways of doing something, PSD will do both, in
different places. It will then make up three more ways no sane human would
think of, and do those too. PSD makes inconsistency an art form. Why, for
instance, did it suddenly decide that *these* particular chunks should be
aligned to four bytes, and that this alignment should *not* be included in the
size? Other chunks in other places are either unaligned, or aligned with the
alignment included in the size. Here, though, it is not included. Either one
of these three behaviours would be fine. A sane format would pick one. PSD, of
course, uses all three, and more.

Trying to get data out of a PSD file is like trying to find something in the
attic of your eccentric old uncle who died in a freak freshwater shark attack
on his 58th birthday. That last detail may not be important for the purposes
of the simile, but at this point I am spending a lot of time imagining amusing
fates for the people responsible for this Rube Goldberg of a file format.

Earlier, I tried to get a hold of the latest specs for the PSD file format. To
do this, I had to apply to them for permission to apply to them to have them
consider sending me this sacred tome. This would have involved faxing them a
copy of some document or other, probably signed in blood. I can only imagine
that they make this process so difficult because they are intensely ashamed of
having created this abomination. I was naturally not gullible enough to go
through with this procedure, but if I had done so, I would have printed out
every single page of the spec, and set them all on fire. Were it within my
power, I would gather every single copy of those specs, and launch them on a
spaceship directly into the sun.

PSD is not my favourite file format.

So what should I do to eliminate it?

>>>

Maybe Just Nothing

The issue is that you can't special case get_current_coords to be truish, as
far as Devel::Cover is concerned - it might not be.

Any fix that could be thought up is inherently problematic.

Coverage reporting is not done for the pretty colors - a human reads it, and
says "OK, this is logical, get_current_coords always returns a true value".
It's not a race for greens and percentages.

>>>

While I agree coverage is not a race, I disagree that a human should have to
disambiguate between real missing coverage and a false negative. At least not
more than once.

I'll make the same argument "no broken windows" argument here that I do about
warnings and tests: eliminate all warnings, even if they are dubious. Ensure
all tests pass eliminating all false negatives. Do not leave any "expected
warnings" or "expected failures" because this erodes the confidence in the
test suite. Warnings and test failures fail to ring alarm bells. One
"expected" warning leads to two. Then four. Then finally too many to remember
which are expected and which are not and you ignore them all together.

The Pragmatic Programmer does a good job with this argument.
http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/extracts/no_broken_windows.html

So goes the same with coverage. Red should be a BAD color, something you do
not want to see. You want to eliminate the red. But sometimes its a false
negative. In that case there should be some way to tell the tool that it is,
in fact, a false negative. Just like skipping tests, you store the fact that
there is a false negative to make the red go away. Red remains a bad color and
seeing it means something is wrong. The team doesn't have to remember which
bits are expected to be uncovered and which are not.

What's missing is a way to let Devel::Cover know that a bit of coverage is not
necessary. The first way to do this which pops into my mind is a comment.

my $foo = $bar || default(); # DC ignore X|0

"Hey, Devel::Cover! Ignore the case where the right side of this logic is
false."

Ignored conditions would be green, but perhaps a slightly different shade of
green so they can be spotted if you're looking for them.

2. Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and

While I don't claim to be a great programmer, I try to imitate one. An
important trait of the great ones is constructive laziness. They know that you
get an A not for effort but for results, and that it's almost always easier to
start from a good partial solution than from nothing at all.

Linus Torvalds, for example, didn't actually try to write Linux from scratch.
Instead, he started by reusing code and ideas from Minix, a tiny Unix-like
operating system for PC clones. Eventually all the Minix code went away or was
completely rewritten—but while it was there, it provided scaffolding for the
infant that would eventually become Linux.

Of her charitable pursuits, she (= Sarah Michelle Gellar) says:

<<<

I started because my mother taught me a long time ago that even when you have
nothing, there's ways to give back. And what you get in return for that is
tenfold. But it was always hard because I couldn't do a lot. I couldn't do
much more than just donate money when I was on [Buffy] because there wasn't
time. And now that I have the time, it's amazing.

Seems like these four rabbis had a series of theological arguments, and three
were always in accord against the fourth. One day, the odd rabbi out, with the
usual "3 to 1, majority rules" statement that signified that he had lost
again, decided to appeal to a higher authority. "Oh, God!" he cried. "I know
in my heart that I am right and they are wrong! Please show me a sign, so they
too will know that I understand Your laws."

It was a beautiful, sunny day. As soon as the rabbi finished his plaint, a
storm cloud moved across the sky above the four. It rumbled once and
dissolved. "A sign from God! See, I'm right, I knew it!" But the other three
disagreed, pointing out that stormclouds form on hot days.

So he asked again: "Oh, God, I need a bigger sign to show that I am right and
they are wrong. So please, God, a bigger sign."

This time four stormclouds appeared, rushed toward each other to form one big
cloud, and a bolt of lightning knocked down a tree ten feet away from the
rabbis. The cloud dispersed at once. "I told you I was right!" insisted the
loner, but the others insisted that nothing had happened that could not be
explained by natural causes.

The insisting rabbi is all ready to ask for a *very big* sign when just as he
says "Oh God..." the sky turns pitch black, the earth shakes, and a deep,
booming voice intones, "HEEEEEEEE'S RIIIIIIIGHT!"

The sky returns to normal. The one rabbi puts his hands on his hips and
snarls, "Well?" "Okay, okayyyy," replied another, "so now it's 3 to 2!"

There is a Chinese story of a farmer who used an old horse to till his fields.
One day, the horse escaped into the hills and when the farmer's neighbors
sympathized with the old man over his bad luck, the farmer replied, "Bad luck?
Good luck? Who knows?" A week later, the horse returned with a herd of horses
from the hills and this time the neighbors congratulated the farmer on his
good luck. His reply was, "Good luck? Bad luck? Who knows?"

Then, when the farmer's son was attempting to tame one of the wild horses, he
fell off its back and broke his leg. Everyone thought this very bad luck. Not
the farmer, whose only reaction was, "Bad luck? Good luck? Who knows?"

Some weeks later, the army marched into the village and conscripted every
able-bodied youth they found there. When they saw the farmer's son with his
broken leg, they let him off. Now was that good luck or bad luck?

Who knows?

Everything that seems on the surface to be an evil may be a good in disguise.
And everything that seems good on the surface may really be an evil. So we are
wise when we leave it to God to decide what is good fortune and what
misfortune, and thank him that all things turn out for good with those who
love him.

above the interests of the public?"

Basically, there were two sides to the world. There was the entire computer
games software industry engaged in a tremendous effort to stamp out piracy,
and there was Wobbler. Currently, Wobbler was in front.

Liberals target Christians instead of Muslims for the same reason that PETA
targets women wearing fur instead of biker gangs wearing leather…

Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build
bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce
bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.

[Verse 1]
Before last night I was down on my luck
There was nothing going my way
Before last night wasn't feelin' the love
No reason for a smile on my face
But I was always told you could turn it around
Do it for the light of day
So get yourself together, head out on the town
The music gets you feeling okay
Now I'm on a roll and I'm losing control, 'cause

[Chorus]
I got that sunshine
It's like the world is mine
I can't deny I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good)
Can't stop from smiling, I'm bottled lightning
Oh, deep inside I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good)
All my heartbreak, my long and rainy days
Are gone and now I can't complain
Everything's alright, I'm feeling so alive
I can't deny I'm feelin' good, yeah

[Verse 2]
I was so low on a Friday alone
No one even calling my phone
I looked in the mirror and I said to myself
Why am I still sitting at home?
Now I'm on a roll and I'm losing control, 'cause

[Chorus]
I got that sunshine
It's like the world is mine
I can't deny I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good)
Can't stop from smiling, I'm bottled lightning
Oh, deep inside I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good)
All my heartbreak, my long and rainy days
Are gone and now I can't complain
Everything's alright, I'm feeling so alive
I can't deny I'm feelin' good, yeah

[Bridge]
I got that sunshine, world is mine, I'm feelin' good
I feel it deep inside, can't deny I'm feelin' good
Everything's alright, so alive
I'm feelin' good, I'm feelin' good, I'm feelin' good
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
I got that sunshine
It's like the world is mine
I can't deny I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good)
Can't stop from smiling, I'm bottled lightning
Oh, deep inside I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good)
Yeah, all my heartbreak, my long and rainy days
Are gone and now I can't complain (No, no, I can't complain)
Everything's alright (Alright), I'm feeling so alive
I can't deny I'm

[Chorus]
I got that sunshine
It's like the world is mine (Yeah)
I can't deny I'm feelin' good (Oh, I can't deny I'm feelin' good)
Can't stop from smiling (Smiling), I'm bottled lightning
Oh, deep inside I'm feelin' good, yeah
All my heartbreak, my long and rainy days
Are gone and now I can't complain (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Everything's alright (Alright), I'm feeling so alive, yeah
I can't deny I'm feelin' good, yeah
