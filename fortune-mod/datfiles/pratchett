The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. 
A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair 
of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell 
when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of 
boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he 
could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of 
the cobbles.

But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could 
afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry 
in ten years’ time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would 
have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have 
wet feet.

This was the Captain Samuel Vimes “Boots” theory of socioeconomic unfairness.

In Reading [England] there is this thing called the IDR, short for "Inner

orbit the town centre permanently". It's a 2-3 lane dual carriageway that
goes round the town centre. It has lots of roundabouts, an overhead
section, a couple of spare motorway-like exits (that's British motorways --
y'know, the roundabout with the main road going under it), and a thing
called the Watlington Street Gyratory, where you have to get in lane for
your intended destination about three years and two corners before you get
there *with no signposting*. I used to cycle along it every day to get to

The only things known to go faster than ordinary light is monarchy,
according to the philosopher Ly Tin Weedle. He reasoned like this: you
can't have more than one king, and tradition demands that there is no gap
between kings, so when a king dies the succession must therefore pass to
the heir *instantaneously*. Presumably, he said, there must be some
elementary particles -- kingons, or possibly queons -- that do this job,
but of course succession sometimes fails if, in mid-flight, they strike an
anti-particle, or republicon. His ambitious plans to use his discovery to
send messages, involving the careful torturing of a small king in order to
modulate the signal, were never fully expanded because, at that point, the
bar closed.

The point is that descriptive writing is very rarely entirely accurate and
during the reign of Olaf Quimby II as Patrician of Ankh some legislation
was passed in a determined attempt to put a stop to this sort of thing and
introduce some honesty into reporting. Thus, if a legend said of a notable

add hastily "except for a couple of people in his home village who thought
he was a liar, and quite a lot of other people who had never really heard
