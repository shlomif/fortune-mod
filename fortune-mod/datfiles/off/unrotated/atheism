 I don't care if it rains or freezes
 Long as I have my plastic Jesus
 Riding on the dashboard of my car
 Through my trials and tribulations
 And my travels through the nations
 With my plastic Jesus I'll go far

 Plastic Jesus, plastic Jesus
 Riding on the dashboard of my car
 I'm afraid he'll have to go
 His magnets ruin my radio
 And if I have a wreck He'll leave a scar

 Riding down a thoroughfare
 With his nose up in the air
 A wreck may be ahead but he don't mind
 Trouble coming He don't see
 He just keeps his eye on me
 And any other thing that lies behind

 Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus
 Riding on the dashboard of my car
 Though the sunshine on His back
 Make Him peel, chip and crack
 A little patching keeps Him up to par

 When pedestrians try to cross
 I let them know who's boss
 I never blow the horn or give them warning
 I ride all over town
 trying to run them down
 And it's seldom that they live to see the morning

 Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus
 Riding on the dashboard of my car
 His halo fits just right
 And I use it for a sight
 And they'll scatter or they'll splatter near and far

 When I'm in a traffic jam
 He don't care if I say "damn"
 I can let all sorts of curses roll
 Plastic Jesus doesn't hear
 For he has a plastic ear
 The man who invented plastic saved my soul

 Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus
 Riding on the dashboard of my car
 Once His robe was snowy white
 Now it isn't quite bright
 Stained by the smoke of my cigar

 If I weave around at night
 And the police think I'm tight
 They'll never find my bottle though they ask
 Plastic Jesus shelters me
 For his head comes off you see
 He's hollow and I use Him for a flask

 Plastic Jesus, Plastic Jesus
 Riding on the dashboard of my car
 Ride with me and have a dram
 Of the blood of the Lamb
 Plastic Jesus is a holy bar.

   ["Plastic Jesus", circa 1969, sign-on
    song of disk jockey Don Imis]

I don't care if it rains or freezes
Long as I've got my plastic jesus
Sitting on the dashboard of my car
Comes in colors pink and pleasant
Glows in the dark cause it's iridescent
Take it with you when you travel far.

Get yourself a sweet madonna
Dressed in rhinestones sitting on a
Pedestal of abalone shell
Going ninety I aint scary
Cause I've got the virgin mary
Telling me that I won't go to hell.

SUNDAY SERMON

A technician, wrapped in a stiff, white smock,
 takes an albino rat from the big crate
 delivered just that morning, puts it in
 the God Model Box, leaves and locks the room.
The box, with random corners and angles,
 is monitored by a ceiling mounted
 video camera.
A switch mounted in one corner is well
 protected by spring wire traps, barriers
 and rat repellent.
The switch delivers an electric shock
 when touched by the rat.
The experiment lasts 24 hours
 or so, depending on the whim and will
 of the technician.
If during that time, the rat sits on the
 switch for thirty or forty seconds,
 the technician will set it free in the
 field behind the fence.
Otherwise, he will restrain the rat in
 a vice and slowly pull off its tail and
 its legs, one by one, then skin it and leave
 it to die
 slowly.

Little is learned in this experiment
 either by the rat or the technician
 who is not at all surprised that none of
 rats ever perform the required task.
But the technician does get to skin a
 lot of rats, and he likes to hear them squeal.

When we meet our maker.

So, good Christians take my advice.
Don't be so egotistic.
And on occasion in your prayers
Address some other mystic.

Remember there have been a score,
A hundred, thousands, maybe more.
To say there is but one God
Might make the others sore.

"...And no philosophy, sadly, has all the answers.  No matter how assured
 we may be about certain aspects of our belief, there are always painful
 inconsistencies, exceptions, and contradictions.  This is true in religion as
 it is in politics, and is self-evident to all except fanatics and the naive.
 As for the fanatics, whose number is legion in our own time, we might be
 advised to leave them to heaven.  They will not, unfortunately, do us the
 same courtesy.  They attack us and each other, and whatever their
 protestations to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history makes clear
 that they are easily disposed to restore to the sword.  My own belief in
 God, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge.  My respect
 for Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems to have been the
 most virtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth.  But even well-educated Christians
 are frustated in their thirst for certainty about the beloved figure
 of Jesus because of the undeniable ambiguity of the scriptural record.
 Such ambiguity is not apparent to children or fanatics, but every
 recognized Bible scholar is perfectly aware of it.  Some Christians, alas,
 resort to formal lying to obscure such reality."

 sense of community and purpose sought by all decent societies might be
 advanced. But though the First Amendment does not allow the government to

"The temperature of Heaven can be rather accurately computed. Our authority
 is Isaiah 30:26, "Moreover, the light of the Moon shall be as the light of
 the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven
 days."  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much radiation as we do from
 the Sun, and in addition 7*7 (49) times as much as the Earth does from the
 Sun, or 50 times in all.  The light we receive from the Moon is one
 1/10,000 of the light we receive from the Sun, so we can ignore that ...
 The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to the point where the heat
 lost by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation, i.e.,
 Heaven loses 50 times as much heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using the
 Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E) temperature of the earth (-300K),
 gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact temperature of Hell cannot be computed...
 (However) Revelations 21:8 says "But the fearful, and unbelieving ... shall
 have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone."  A lake
 of molten brimstone means that its temperature must be at or below the
 boiling point, 444.6C. We have, then, that Heaven, at 525C is hotter than
 Hell at 445C."

"Religion closes off the central questions of existence by attempting to
 dissuade us from further enquiry by asserting that we cannot ever hope to

 comprehension. It seeks to thwart, by encouraging awe in things unseen,
 the disclosure of the emptiness of faith. Religion, in contrast to
 science, deploys the repugnant view that the world is too big for our
 understanding. Science, in contrast to religion, opens up the great
 questions of being to rational discussion, to discussion with the
 prospect of resolution and elucidation. Science, above all, respects the
 power of the human intellect. Science is the apotheosis of the intellect
 and the consummation of the Rennaissance. Science respects more deeply

"When someone comes and proselytizes for another god or another final authority
 (and by the way, that god may be man)--when someone tries to undermine the
 commitment to Jehovah which is fundamental to the civil order of a godly
 state--then that person needs to be restrained by the magistrate. However,
 this does not mean that individuals should be punished for holding heretical
 views, the views that Baptists think are heretical or Lutherans think are
 heretical and so forth. It simply means that those who will not acknowledge
 Jehovah as the ultimate authority behind the civil law code which the
 magistrate is enforcing would be punished and repressed. You would, therefore,
 be open, I believe, to hold Muslim views or Hindu views in the privacy of your
 own home, provided it was not a Christian home that you've now come into to
 subvert and draw away from Jehovah. You would be able to hold these views as a
 private conviction.  But you would not be allowed to proselytize and undermine
 the order of the state. Before people who are non-theonomists get too terribly
 upset about this view, I would at least ask them to reflect on this fact:

"They [religious idealists] say in a single breath: "God and the liberty
 of man," "God and the dignity, justice, equality, fraternity, prosperity
 of men" -- regardless of the fatal logic by virtue of which, if God
 exists, all these things are condemned to nonexistence. For, if God is,
 he is necessarily the eternal, supreme, absolute master, and, if such a
 master exists, man is a slave. Now, if he is a slave, neither justice,
 nor equality, nor fraternity, nor prosperity are possible for him. In
 vain, flying in the face of good sense and all the teachings of history,
 do they represent their God as animated by the tenderest love of human
 liberty. A master, whoever he may be and however liberal he may desire
 to show himself, remains none the less always a master."

"With the name of God they imagine that they can establish fraternity among
 men, and on the contrary, they create pride, contempt; they sow discord,
 hatred, war; they establish slavery.  For with God came the different
 degrees of divine inspiration; humanity is divided into men highly inspired,
 less inspired, uninspired.  All are equally insignificant before God, it is
 true; but compared with each other, some are greater than others; not only
 in fact- which would be of no consequence, because inequality in fact is
 lost in the collectivity when it cannot cling to some legal fiction or
 institution- but by the divine right of inspiration, which immediately
 establishes a fixed, constant, petrifying inequality.  The highly inspired
 must be listened to and obeyed by the less inspired, and the less inspired
 by the uninspired.  Thus we have the principle of authority well established,
 and with it the two fundamental institutions of slavery: Church and State."

 A Chapel was built in the midst,
 Where I used to play on the green.

 And the gates of this Chapel were shut,
 And "Thou shalt not" writ over the door;
 So I turn'd to the Garden of Love
 That so many sweet flowers bore;

 And I saw it was filled with graves,
 And tomb-stones where flowers should be;
 And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,
 And binding with briars my joy and desires.

  That picks up crumbs around the door."

  In trembling zeal he seiz'd his hair:
  He led him by his little coat,
  And all admir'd the priestly care.

  And standing on the altar high,
  "Lo! what a fiend is here!" said he,
  "One who sets reason up for judge
  Of our most holy Mystery."

  And bound him in an iron chain;

"Entering the city [Jerusalem, July 15, 1099], our pilgrims pursued and killed
 Saracens up to the Temple of Solomon, in which they had assembled and where
 they gave battle to us furiously for the whole day so that their blood flowed
 throughout the whole temple.  Finally, having overcome the pagans, our
 knights seized a great number of men and women, and the killed whom they
 wished and whom they wished they let live....  Then, rejoicing and weeping
 from extreme joy, our men went to worship at the sepulchre of jour Saviour
 Jesus and thus fulfilled their pledge to Him....  They also ordered that all
 the Saracen dead should be thrown out of the city because of the extreme
 stench, for the city was almost full of their cadavers.  The live Saracens
 dragged the dead out before the gates and made piles of them, like houses.
 No one has ever heard of or seen such a slaughter of pagan peoples since
 pyres were made of them like boundary marks, and no one except God knows
 their number."

"But in what sense can [the United States] be called a Christian nation?
 Not in the sense that Christianity is the established religion or the
 people are compelled in any manner to support it. On the contrary, the
 Constitution specifically provides that 'congress shall make no law
 respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
 thereof.' Neither is it Christian in the sense that all its citizens are
 either in fact or in name Christians. On the contrary, all religions have
 free scope within its borders. Numbers of our people profess other
 religions, and many reject all.  Nor is it Christian in the sense that a
 profession of Christianity is a condition of holding office or otherwise
 engaging in public service, or essential to recognition either politically
 or socially.  In fact, the government as a legal organization is independent
 of all religions."

 result, that is, the establishment of religion, is not always easily

 a state religion but nevertheless be one "respecting" that end in the sense
 of being a step that could lead to such establishment and hence offend

 rightly come to grief, as I did when I first sought to justify my former

"The popular notion that witches were burned is quite false.  In fact, no
 witches were burned at any time in Salem or anywhere else in America.  Nor
 were witches by any means all women; in fact, they were not all even human
 beings.  Two dogs were actually put to death in Salem for 'witchcraft.'
 The means of execution in all cases, including the unfortunate dogs, was by
 hanging, with one exception: an old man named Giles Corey. ...Corey's death
 was by 'pressing'; heavy stones were placed upon his chest in an attempt to
 force him to plead [he protected his kin by refusing to plead either way].
 ...Nor was the witchcraft hysteria confined to Salem; Andover, Massachusetts,
 was caught up in it before the affair had run its course, and at least one
 witch was found in Maine.  Salem was not, as a matter of fact, even the first
 to hang a witch.  An old woman in Boston had confessed to witchcraft and been
 hanged in 1688, four years before the first execution in Salem."

"It is a common saying that thought is free.  A man can never be hindered from
 thinking whatever he chooses so long as he conceals what he thinks.  The
 working of his mind is limited only by the bounds of his experience and the
 power of his imagination.  But this natural liberty of private thinking is of
 little value.  It is unsatisfactory and even painful to the thinker himself,
 if he is not permitted to communicate his thoughts to others, and it is
 obviously of no value to his neighbors.  Moreover it is extremely difficult
 to hide thoughts that have any power over the mind.  If a man's thinking leads
 him to call in question ideas and customs which regulate the behaviour of
 those about him, to reject the beliefs which they hold, to see better ways of
 life than those they follow, it is almost impossible for him, if he is
 convinced of the truth of his own reasoning, not to betray by silence, chance
 words, or general attitude that he is different from them and does not share
 their opinions.  Some have preferred, like Socrates, some would prefer today,
 to face death rather than conceal their thoughts.  Thus freedom of thought,
 in any valuable sense, includes freedom of speech."

 And most of this praying takes place on Sunday.  And I say fine, pray for
 anything you want.  Pray for anything.  But...what about the divine plan?
 Remember that? The divine plan. Long time ago god made a divine plan.  Gave
 it a lot of thought. Decided it was a good plan. Put it into practice.  And
 for billion and billions of years the divine plan has been doing just fine.
 Now you come along and pray for something. Well, suppose the thing you want
 isn't in god's divine plan.  What do you want him to do?  Change his plan?
 Just for you? Doesn't it seem a little arrogant? It's a divine plan. What's
 the use of being god if every run-down schmuck with a two dollar prayer book
 can come along and fuck up your plan?  And here's something else, another
 problem you might have; suppose your prayers aren't answered. What do you
 say? 'Well it's god's will. God's will be done.' Fine, but if it gods will
 and he's going to do whatever he wants to anyway; why the fuck bother praying
 in the first place? Seems like a big waste of time to me. Couldn't you just
 skip the praying part and get right to his will?"

 I think he's a good actor. Ok. To me, that counts. Second; he looks like
 a guy who can get things done. Joe Pesci doesn't fuck around. Doesn't
 fuck around. In fact, Joe Pesci came through on a couple of things that
 god was having trouble with. For years I asked god to do something about
 my noisy neighbor with the barking dog. Joe Pesci straightened that
 cock-sucker out with one visit."

 Same as the four leaf clover, the horse shoe, the rabbit's foot, and the
 wishing well. Same as the mojo man. Same as the voodoo lady who tells your
 fortune by squeezing the goat's testicles.  It's all the same; 50/50. So just
 pick your superstitions, sit back, make a wish and enjoy yourself. And for
 those of you that look to the Bible for it's literary qualities and moral
 lessons; I got a couple other stories I might like to recommend for you. You
 might enjoy The Three Little Pigs. That's a good one. It has a nice happy
 ending. Then there's Little Red Riding Hood. Although it does have that one
 x-rated part where the Big-Bad-Wolf actually eats the grandmother. Which I
 didn't care for, by the way. And finally, I've always drawn a great deal of
 moral comfort from Humpty Dumpty. The part I liked best: ...and all the
 king's horses, and all the king's men couldn't put Humpty together again.
 That's because there is no Humpty Dumpty, and there is no god.  None.

 in its knowledge of the workings of nature, it was only natural that some
 people began to question the efficacy of the priests and their magical
 rituals. Indeed, as people became aware of natural causes, they began to
 question the very existence of the gods themselves. The priests' answer to
 this skepticism was twofold: invoking the power of the state to exterminate
 dangerous freethought, and concurrently developing even more complex,
 serpentine, theological logic. Many philosophers were not taken in by this
 specious reasoning. They demonstrated that, fundamentally, all theology and
 metaphysics is pseudolearning, a semantic sleight of hand to give the
 appearance that superstitious beliefs have an intellectual, rational
 foundation. They further showed that, by definition, God, if he existed,
 would be unknowable. Yet theology--bolstered by the semantic alchemy of
 metaphysics--attempted to discuss God as if he could be discovered by

 philosophers over the years, including briefly by the atheistic Bertrand
 Russell.  Nevertheless, even theologians have not generally been prepared to
 defend it.  One problem lies with the treatment of "existence" as if it were
 a property of things, like mass or color.  Thus the argument obliges one to
 compare the concepts of gods-that-really-exist and gods-that-don't-really-

"Consider the idea of God. We do not know how it arose in the meme pool.
 Probably it originated many times by independent 'mutation.' In any case,
 it is very old indeed. How does it replicate itself? By the spoken and
 written word, aided by great music and great art. Why does it have such
 high survival value? Remember that 'survival value' here does not mean
 value for a gene in a gene pool, but value for a meme in a meme pool. The
 question really means: What is it about the idea of a god that gives it its
 stability and penetrance in the cultural environment? The survival value of
 the god meme in the meme pool results from its great psychological appeal.
 It provides a superficially plausible answer to deep and troubling
 questions about existence. It suggests that injustices in this world may be
 rectified in the next. The 'everlasting arms' hold out a cushion against
 our own inadequacies which, like a doctor's placebo, is none the less
 effective for being imaginary. There are some of the reasons why the idea
 of God is copied so readily by successive generations of individual brains.

 Nothing is more lethal for certain kinds of meme than a tendency to look

 phallic sign of life, into the Christian cross, and they copied the high-
 pointed headdress of Osiris as their prototype for Saint Peter's papal tiara.
 There could only be four gospels written. The reason there are only four
 biblical gospels was because Saint Jerome believed in the four cardinal gods
 of the zodiac. But who was father of the four "cardinal" gods of the zodiac?
 Yes, indeed! It was the divine Egyptian son Horus, whose birthday was on the

Found new life in Jesus Christ

"Already the spirit of our schooling is permeated with the feeling that
 every subject, every topic, every fact, every professed truth must be
 submitted to a certain publicity and impartiality.  All proffered
 samples of learning must go to the same assay-room and be subjected to
 common tests.  It is the essence of all dogmatic faiths to hold that
 any such "show-down" is sacrilegious and perverse.  The characteristic
 of religion, from their point of view, is that it is intellectually
 secret, not public; peculiarly revealed, not generally known;
 authoritatively declared, not communicated and tested in ordinary
 ways...It is pertinent to point out that, as long as religion is
 conceived as it is now by the great majority of professed religionists,
 there is something self-contradictory in speaking of education in
 religion in the same sense in which we speak of education in topics
 where the method of free inquiry has made its way.  The "religious"
 would be the last to be willing that either the history or the
 content of religion should be taught in this spirit; while those

"Faith will survive all superstitions, compelling men to think in terms of
 their own destiny and the responsibility they themselves have in forging
 that destiny. No one explains how declarations that are manufactured out of
 whole cloth, that have absolutely no predictive content and therefore no
 demonstrable connection with our lives as we live them day by day, are
 supposed to serve as a guide for planning our future. What such declarations
 do is to condition every nervous system that takes them seriously that it is
 perfectly sane to ignore the world in which we live, and to live instead in
 a world of pure fantasy. The man who is willing to accept the doctrine of
 Christian faith is one who is willing to relinquish all hope of knowing the
 truth. He accepts all, doubts never, vegetates. He is a slave, a hollow shell
 into which others can pour all manner of stupidities. Having a conscience,
 being honest, are empty phrases for him, as he has relinquished his own right
 to think and is acting only because others are acting through him. He refuses
 to be honest with himself, no longer talks things over with himself, no longer
 meditates, contemplates; he only absorbs like a sponge, without discrimination.
 If he has convictions, they are metamorphized and petrified lies, and not even
 his own lies but those of colleagues, priests, and politicians who want to use
 him. If to accept blindly, without the play of reason, is faith, it follows
 then that what the world needs is not more faith, but more people who think
 with their own heads and not with the heads of others."

 in times of depression and conflict, and the greater success of all

"Reason and faith are completely irreconcilable pathways to knowledge. The two
 cannot exist side by side. Reason underlies the methodology of the scientist.
 Without it he would be ineffectual. Faith is the "being" of the "religionist."
 Without it he could not exist. The scientist accepts nothing on faith. Faith
 to him is a synonym for belief. In Hebrews 11:1 we read: "Faith is the
 substance of things desired, the evidence of things unseen." The "religionist"
 is ever alert to prevent reason from undermining his precepts. Reason is his
 (and God's) worst enemy. Reason is our means of processing what we learn of
 the world through our proverbial five senses. Faith does no processing;
 whatever sense (or nonsense) is accepted as is, without rational consideration.
 Those facts which reason allows us to accept must display consistency and
 predictability. There are no criteria to restrict that which we will accept
 on faith, as section 61 of this book shows. Those content to accept on faith
 are those who accept without thinking, without the rational demonstrations
 that establish the truth (predictive content) of what we believe. Faith is
 the road to myth and error, the way to add to man's already overflowing
 storehouse of "things he _knows_ but that are not so."

 deeper into error." The person with the self-sealing system that Oppenheimer
 describes (section 18) cannot be convinced at all. He has become uncannily
 proficient at transmuting all experiential verification to conform to that
 which he wants to believe. He now has adequate defenses against countervailing
 evidence to discount almost anything that would prove detrimental to his
 cherished beliefs, to revamp information that threatens long-established
 convictions. Religious faith (which is just such a closed system), if strong
 enough, will protect a person from the arguments appearing in a book such as
 this, just as the faith of people who want to believe that their destinies
 lie in the stars is enough to protect them from the declarations of 186 noted
 scientists who feel it important to convince them that they are wrong.
 Bertrand Russell was talking about this kind of "religious" faith when, in
 'Human Society in Ethics and Politics', he tells us that he believes that all
 faiths do harm.  He defines faith as the belief in anything for which no
 evidence exists. If there is evidence, faith is not required. We do not need
 faith to believe that vinegar is bitter or that water is wet. We use the term
 faith only when emotion dominates reason. Faith, for Mencken, was a kind of
 clearing house for all the various conspiracies religionists contrive in order
 to deny or distort the facts that our senses present to us to make up what we
 call our existence. Faith, he was sure, is the force that foments the
 concerted attacks against what can be called a rational moral philosophy."

"But there is a kind of faith, as we all well know, that is an essential
 ingredient in the lives of all human beings. This faith is of a different
 sort, not faith in (or in the existence of) a pathologically jealous supreme
 being who would have us all wasting our valuable time in endless, meaningless
 rituals "glorifying his name." Nor is it faith in a mythological hell in
 which we will all fry for eternity who do not genuflect to this demeaning
 concept of the utter dependence of the human species. Alan Watts says in
 'The Book,' "Irrevocable commitment to any religion is not only intellectual
 suicide; it is positive unfaith because it closes the mind to any new vision
 of the world. Faith is, above all, openness - an act of trust in the unknown."
 What we need is faith in the boundless reach of an open mind. Having an open
 mind does not mean that we do not have firm convictions, but that we are not
 afraid of new ideas. Persons with firm convictions, well founded, need new
 ideas from time to time, against which they can constantly test their
 convictions in a changing world, perhaps to alter them or perhaps to make
 their convictions even more firm. If we are confident of the truth and
 validity of our convictions, whatever they may be, we have nothing to fear.
 We shall not serve our convictions, whatever they may be, by self-deception.
 Convictions that can be defended only by disregarding facts, lying to
 oneself and others, are not worth keeping."

"Man needs faith in his own potential, faith in his ability, within limits, to
 plan his own life. He must have faith that nature is subject to laws, that the
 earth will continue to turn on its axis, and the sun will continue for a few
 billion more years to warm the earth, and that there will be rain to make the
 plants grow and thus to maintain life on this planet. The very world itself is
 a matter of faith. It is an act of faith to believe that there exists a world
 beyond our own skins. Our faith is not to deny the unknown, to avoid it, or to
 pretend that the unknown is really known. Our faith is above all resolute
 belief in ourselves as sovereign individuals. We must understand that beyond
 ourselves there is no baleful influence bent on frustrating our hopes and
 plans - even those plagued constantly with difficulties. Nature, we must
 understand, is not deliberately malign nor deliberately benign; it is simply
 indifferent. With Amado Nervo (who gets the last word in this essay), we must
 see ourselves as the architect of our own destinies."

"The Reverend Robert H. Schuller, second to none in the multiformity of his
 televised effusions, gives us more than three hundred definitions of the word
 faith. He could go on forever. In his 'Tough-Minded Faith for Tender-Hearted
 People' [muddleminded faith for simpleminded people] Schuller makes it plain
 that "faith" can be dictum, psychological judgment, scientific proposition,
 or mystic symbolism. It can be whatever puritanical perception, frivolous
 fancy, arbitrary assumption, or capricious conviction. It can be both horse
 and vehicle, north and south, sinister and dexter, verso and recto, larboard
 and starboard.  There are no restrictions. Faith has so many meanings to
 Schuller that it is meaningless. Meaning everything, it means nothing - as is
 usually the case when religionists use the term faith."

"Just as Philo, learned in Greek speculation, had felt a need to rephrase
 Judaism in forms acceptable to the logic-loving Greeks, so John, having
 lived for two generations in a Hellenistic environment, sought to give a
 Greek philosophical tinge to the mystic Jewish doctrine that the Wisdom
 of God was a living being, and to the Christian doctrine that Jesus was
 the Messiah. Consciously or not, he continued Paul's work of detaching
 Christianity from Judaism. Christ was no longer presented as a Jew, living
 more or less under the Jewish Law; he was make to address the Jews as
 "you," and to speak of their Law as "yours"; he was not a Messiah sent
 "to save the lost sheep of Israel," he was the coeternal Son of God; not
 merely the future judge of mankind, but the primeval creator of the
 universe. In this perspective the Jewish life of the man Jesus could
 be put into the background, faded almost as in Gnostic heresy; and the
 god Christ was assimilated to the religious and philosophical traditions
 of the Hellenistic mind. Now the pagan world-- even the anti-Semitic
 world--could accept him as its own."

"Christianity did not destroy paganism; it adopted it. The Greek mind
 dying, came to a tranmigrated life in the theology and liturgy of the
 Church; the Greek language, having reigned for centuries over philosophy,
 became the vehicle of Christian literature and ritual; the Greek mysteries
 passed down into the impressive mystery of the Mass.  Other pagan cultures
 contributed to the syncretist result. From Egypt came the ideas of a divine
 trinity, the Last Judgement, and a personal immortality of reward and
 punishment; from Egypt the adoration of the Mother and Child, and the mystic
 theosophy that made Neoplatonism and Gnosticism, and obscured the Christian
 creed; there, too, Christian monasticism would find its exemplars and its
 source. From Phrygia came the worship of the Great Mother; from Syria the
 resurrection drama of Adonis; from Thrace, perhaps the cult of Dionysus, the
 dying and saving god. From Persia came millennarianism, the "ages of the
 world," the "final conflagration," the dualism of Satan and God, of Darkness
 and Light; already in the Forth Gospel Christ is the "Light shining in the
 darkness, and the darkness has never put it out." The Mithraic ritual so
 closely resembled the eucharistic sacrifice of the Mass that Christian fathers
 charged the Devil with inventing these similarities to mislead frail minds.

 him infinitely more than ever a stubborn rebel did his prince; and yet it is
 nothing but his hand that holds you from falling into the fire every moment.
 It is to be ascribed to nothing else, that you did not go to hell the last

"...a doctrine which is able to maintain itself not in clear light but only
 in the dark, will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable
 harm to human progress. In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of
 religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God,
 that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such
 vast power in the hands of priests.... The further the spiritual evolution
 of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine
 religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and
 blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge."

 Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as

"You will hardly find one among the profounder sort of scientific minds
 without a religious feeling of his own.  But it is different from the
 religiosity of the naive man.  For the latter, God is a being from whose
 care one hopes to benefit and whose punishment one fears; a sublimation of
 a feeling similar to that of a child for its father, a being to whom one
 stands, so to speak, in a personal relation, however deeply it may be
 tinged with awe.

 But the scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation...
 There is nothing divine about morality; it is a purely human affair. His
 religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony
 of natural law, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that,
 compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings
 is an utterly insignificant reflection... It is beyond question closely
 akin to that which has possessed the religious geniuses of all ages."

 demands of us and who takes an interest in us as individuals. There is in this

"To sum up (or I shall be pursuing the infinite), it is quite clear
 that the Christian religion has a kind of kinship with folly in some

 first consider the fact that the very young and the very old, women and
 simpletons, are the people who take the greatest delight in sacred and
 holy things, and are therefore always found nearest the altars, led there
 doubtless solely by their natural instinct.  Secondly, you can see how
 the first great founders of the faith were great lovers of simplicity and
 bitter enemies of learning.  Finally, the biggest fools of all appear to
 be those who have once been wholly possessed by zeal for Christian
 piety.  They squander their possessions, ignore insults, submit to being
 cheated, make no distinction between friends and enemies, shun pleasure,
 sustain themselves on fasting, vigils, tears, toil and humiliations, scorn
 life and desire only death - in short, they seem to be dead to any normal

"She had the dubious distinction of being known as America's most outspoken
 atheist," NBC's Tom Brokaw said (9/30/96) in introducing a jokey segment
 on Madalyn Murray O'Hair, who has been missing for the past year. It's
 impossible to imagine Brokaw making light of the disappearance of someone
 who has the "dubious distinction" of being a leader of America's Catholics
 or Jews--but atheists are assumed to be fair game for ridicule or attack.
 That must be why NBC quoted a "conservative Christian commentator" as saying
 of O'Hair: "If she is indeed dead, then she's burning in the fires of hell."
 Plenty of fundamentalist Christians believe that all Catholics burn in hell,
 but we doubt we'll see NBC quoting any of them the next time a pope dies."

My School Prayer

Now I lay me down to learn
Which to read and which to burn
Pray the Lord my soul to turn
Over to the school board.

Free to worship as I please,
Long as it pleases the authorities.
Hear me praying on my knees
My School Prayer.

"Once again, boys and girls, I'll remind you that this activity
is not mandatory, and those of you who don't believe in a
Judeo-Christian God as defined by Congress should feel free to
sit quietly with your fingers in your ears like the atheistic
heathen you are.  Agnostics may want to plug just one ear."

May my every sneeze be blessed.
May I pass my urine test.
May my mind be underest-
imated and ignored, Lord

Keep my classroom safe and clean.
Sanctify my M-16.
Every morning, eight-fifteen,
It's My School Prayer.

God bless California, Arizona,
North Dakota, Texas, Maine,
New Hampshire,
Ohio and New York, of course.

The forty-eight contiguous,
And the two ambiguous.
The greatest country God ever saved from the pagans.

And while we're at it, dear Lord, bless the Reagans.

God is good, and God is great.
So we'd hate to separate
Church and state or ourselves from pat-
riarchy and theocracy.

Peace on earth, Thy kingdom come
Into my curriculum.
Make my head a hollow drum.

Strike me dumb
Except to mumble
My School Prayer.

"In modern Europe, as in ancient Greece, it would seem that even inanimate
 objects have sometimes been punished for their misdeeds.  After the revocation
 of the edict of Nantes, in 1685, the Protestant chapel at La Rochelle was
 condemned to be demolished, but the bell, perhaps out of regard for its value,
 was spared.  However, to expiate the crime of having rung heretics to prayers,
 it was sentenced to be first whipped, and then buried and disinterred, by way
 of symbolizing its new birth at passing into Catholic hands.  Thereafter it
 was catechized, and obliged to recant and promise that it would never again
 relapse into sin.  Having made this ample and honourable amends, the bell was
 reconciled, baptized, and given, or rather sold, to the parish of St.
 Bartholomew.  But when the governor sent in the bill for the bell to the
 parish authorities, they declined to settle it, alleging that the bell, as
 a recent convert to Catholicism, desired to take advantage of the law lately
 passed by the king, which allowed all new converts a delay of three years in
 paying their debts.

"While the different religions wrangle with one another as to which of them
 is in possession of the truth, in our view the truth of religion may be
 altogether disregarded.  Religion is an attempt to get control over the
 sensory world, in which we are placed, by means of the wish-world, which
 we have developed inside us as a result of biological and psychological
 necessities.  But it cannot achieve its end.  Its doctrines carry with them
 the stamp of the times in which they originated, the ignorant childhood days
 of the human race.  Its consolations deserve no trust.  Experience teaches
 us that the world is not a nursery.  The ethical commands, to which religion
 seeks to lend its weight, require some other foundations instead, for human
 society cannot do without them, and it is dangerous to link up obedience to
 them with religious belief. If one attempts to assign to religion its place
 in man's evolution, it seems not so much to be a lasting acquisition, as a
 parallel to the neurosis which the civilized individual must pass through
 on his way from childhood to maturity."

"As the happiness of a future life is the great object of religion, we may hear
 without surprise or scandal that the introduction, or at least the abuse, of
 Christianity had some influence on the decline and fall of the Roman empire.
 The clergy successfully preached the doctrines of patience and pusillanimity;
 the active virtues of society were discouraged; and the last remains of
 military spirit were buried in the cloister. A large portion of public and
 private wealth was consecrated to the specious demands of charity and
 devotion, and the soldiers' pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of
 both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity. Faith,
 Zeal, curiosity, and more earthly passions of malice and ambition kindled the
 flame of theological factions, whose conflicts were sometimes bloody and
 always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted from camps to
 synods; the Roman world was oppressed by a new species of tyranny, and the
 persecuted sects became the secret enemies of the country."

"School vouchers as proposed by Reagan and Bush do not represent free market
 competition.  The reason is fairly simple.  The source of the money is not

 are an attempt to breach the separation of church and state by allowing
 individuals who are not constrained by the prohibition against Congress
 passing laws respecting religion to spend tax dollars for the benefit of
 the religion of their choice.

 I have no objection to parents sending their children to the school of
 their choice.  The problem with public funding of schools is that it is an
 inherently collectivist system.  The restraints that have been placed on
 what public schools must teach and what they are prohibited from teaching
 protect us to a limited extend from the full magnitude of the damage that
 they have the potential to do if used as a propaganda tool.

 I have never granted that anyone else rightfully has the freedom to choose
 how my money will be spent.  The only difference between that and slavery is
 that the masters do not have the authority to beat, sell, or kill me if I
 choose not to work.  Send your children to schools that brainwash them any
 way that you wish.  But do not insist on paying for it with money taken

 have ceased to interfere with education at the advanced state, with which
 I am directly concerned, but they have still got control of that of
 children.  This means that the children have to learn about Adam and Noah
 instead of about Evolution; about David who killed Goliath, instead of Koch
 who killed cholera; about Christ's ascent into heaven instead of
 Montgolfier's and Wright's.  Worse than that, they are taught that it is
 a virtue to accept statements without adequate evidence, which leaves them
 a prey to quacks of every kind in later life, and makes it very difficult

"This question is put to Christians who believe that the Bible unerringly
 describes God and reports the commands and the characteristics of God. If
 there is a God, it is natural that we should wish to be quite correct in
 our understanding of that God's nature. So, we ask: Can and does God lie?

 Looking this point up in the mazes of Holy Writ, we discover confusion. In
 Numbers xxiii, 19, we are told: "God is not a man, that he should lie."
 This is put even mere strongly in Hebrews vi, 18, where we read: "It was
 impossible for God to lie."

 But do these citations settle the matter? Ah, no, we are upset in, our
 calculations the moment we turn to 2 Thessalonians ii, 11, where we read:
 "For this cause God shall send them strong delusions, that they should
 believe a lie." And in I Kings xxii, 23, God is thus reported: "Now,
 therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all
 these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee."

 somewhere. The big mistake is in entertaining the idea of a God."

 but extravagantly proposes more mysteries than it assumes to explain.  For
 instance, is it sensible that a real God would leave mankind in such confusion
 and debate about his character and his laws?

 There have been many alleged revelations of God. There have, indeed, been many
 Gods as there have been many Bibles. And in different ages and different lands
 an endless game of guessing and disputing has gone on. Men have argued blindly
 about God. They still argue -- just as blindly.

 And if there is a God, we must conclude that he has willfully left men in the
 dark. He has not wanted men to know about him. Assuming his existence, then
 it would follow that he would have perfect ability to give a complete and
 universal explanation of himself, so that all men could see and know without
 further uncertainty. A real God could exhibit himself clearly to all men and
 have all men following his will to the last letter without a doubt or a slip.

 But when we examine even cursorily the many contradictory revelations of God,
 the many theories and arguments, the many and diverse principles of piety, we
 perceive that all this talk about God his been merely the natural floundering
 of human ignorance.

 There has been no reality in the God idea which men could discover and agree

"A few weeks ago a hurricane struck the little religious community of Bethany,
 Okla. A number of pious citizens of the little town were killed. Houses were
 destroyed -- homes in which prayer and devotion reigned. A church was
 demolished.

 Only a few miles away is the large, wicked city of Oklahoma City -- at least
 we can certainly assume that, from the religious viewpoint, many sinners live
 in Oklahoma City. Assuming also (which is a great deal riskier assumption)
 that there is a God, why should he perpetrate this grim and sardonic joke?
 The sinners in the big city were left untouched. The godly folk in the little
 nearby village were punished by the evidences of God's wrath. How do the
 religious people interpret this calamity? Often and often they explain such
 calamities as flood, fire and storm by saying that God is angry at the sinful
 people and is warning them or destroying them for their sins. Was the
 hurricane in Bethany a sign of the love of God for his faithful worshipers?

 And God missed an even better chance, if there were a God who wished to punish
 rebels against his majesty and inscrutability. Just a few hundred miles north
 and east of Bethany, Okla., is Girard -- the home of The American Freeman: and
 The Debunker and The Joseph McCabe Magazine and the Little Blue Books -- the
 center of American free thought where an enormous stream of atheistic
 literature and. godless modern knowledge pours forth to enlighten  the masses.
 If there were a God directing hurricanes and he wanted to really "get" an
 uncompromising foe, whom he has no chance of persuading in the ordinary way,
 it would have been a devastating stroke for him to send his howling punitive
 blasts through the town of Girard. It would be a more remarkable suggestion
 of the avenging act of a God if only the Haldeman-Julius plant were destroyed
 and the rest of the town left unhurt -- and, as good neighbors, we shouldn't
 wish the Christian and respectable, people of Girard nor those who are
 respectable and not so Christian nor those who are Christian and not exactly
 respectable to suffer from our proximity and our propaganda of atheism.

 Is God a joker? No -- let us whisper it -- the joke is that there is no God.

"Credulity is not a crime for the individual -- but it is clearly a crime as
 regards the race. Just look at the actual consequences of credulity. For
 years men believed in the foul superstition of witchcraft and many poor
 people suffered for this foolish belief. There was a general belief in angels
 and demons, flying familiarly, yet skittishly through the air, and that belief
 caused untold distress and pain and tragedy. The most holy Catholic church
 (and, after it, the various Protestant sects) enforced the dogma that heresy
 was terribly sinful and punishable by death. Imagine -- but all you need do
 is to recount -- the suffering entailed by that belief.

 When one surveys the causes and consequences of credulity, it is apparent
 that this easy believer in the impossible, this readiness toward false and
 fanatical notions, has been indeed a most serious and major crime against
 humanity. The social life in any age, it may be said, is about what its extent
 of credulity guarantees. In an extremely credulous age, social life will be

"Is God fair? The Christians say that God damns forever anyone who is skeptical
 about truth of bunkistic religion as revealed unto the holy haranguers.  What
 this means is that a God, if any, punishes a man for using his reason.

 If there is a God in existence, reasons should be available for his
 existence. Assuming that such a precious thing as a man's eternal future
 depends on his belief in a God, then the materials for that belief
 should be overwhelming and not at all doubtful.

 Yet here is a man whose reason makes it impossible for him to believe in
 a God. He sees no evidence of such an entity. He finds all the arguments
 weak and worthless. He doubts and he denies.

 Then is a God fair in visiting upon such a skeptic the penalty for his
 inevitable intellectual attitude? The intelligent man refuses to believe

 portrait of other persons or groups but our very active scene is warped by
 what we have been taught to believe, by what we want to believe and by what

    Only the Priests 'Date' Young
      (to the tune of "Only the Good
       Die Young" by Billy Joel)

Come out Father
Don't make us wait
You Catholic Priests want boys to date
But sooner or later you'll be charged by the State
For things that you may have done.

Well they told you that its a sin to be gay
They told you to kneel but only to pray
But they never told you the price that you pay
For sexual repression
Only the Priests date young.

You got a nice black dress and a party on your ordination
All the wafers you can eat
And free treatment at the Paraclete *
But they don't even permit you to engage in masturbation
Soon the alter boys
They start to look like toys
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

You told the parents all you'd give 'em was an education
You told 'em you'd take care of 'em
But did you even use a condom?
No, No, No, No

    A Christmas Ditty

I.... saw Jesus kissing Santa Claus
Underneath a Unicorn last night.
He is the Son of God
Or else he is a fraud
But I thought it very funny
When he fucked the Easter Bunny

While Leprechauns and Jackalopes did fight
I thank the Tooth Fairy
That Jehovah didn't see

 with so many of the scientists of his generation), all positive dogma was
 for them a superstition of the past.  They never took me to church.  And
 though as part of my general education I was, soon after I had begun to
 read for pleasure, given a child's Bible, it disappeared mysteriously when
 I got too interested in it....

 By the age of fifteen, I had convinced myself that nobody could give a
 reasonable explanation of what he meant by the word 'God' and that it was
 therefore as meaningless to assert a belief as to assert a disbelief in God.

 Though this, in a general way, has remained my position ever since, I
 have always avoided unnecessarily to offend other people holding religious
 belief by displaying my lack of such belief, or even stating my lack of
 belief, if I was not challenged."

THE PREACHER AND THE SLAVE
   by Joe Hill, to the tune

 Long-haired preachers come out every night
 Try and tell you what's wrong and what's right
 But when asked about something to eat
 They will answer in voices so sweet:

 CHORUS:
      You will eat, by and by,
      In the glorious land above the sky (way up high)
      Work and pray, live on hay,
      You'll get pie in the sky when you die (that's a lie!)

 Oh the Starvation Army they play
 And they sing and they clap and they pray
 Till they get all your coin on the drum
 Then they tell you when you're on the bum:

 CHORUS

 Holy Rollers and jumpers come out
 And they roll and they jump and they shout
 Give your money to Jesus, they say
 He will cure all diseases today

 CHORUS

 If you fight hard for children and wife
 Try to get something good in this life
 You're a sinner and bad man, they tell
 When you die you will sure go to Hell

 CHORUS

 Working folks of all countries, unite!
 Side by side we for freedom will fight!
 When this world and its wealth we have gained,
 To the grafters we'll sing this refrain:

 LAST CHORUS:
      You will eat, by and by,
      When you've learned how to cook and to fry (and to fry!)
      Chop some wood, it'll do you good,
      And you'll eat in the sweet by and by (that's no lie!)

"Among the innumerable reasons to scorn the creationists' "argument from
 design" is that no intelligent, let alone loving, Creator could possibly
 have "designed" the male reproductive system in its current form. We, the
 paragon of animals, the Mister Monster, have always been acutely aware that
 our own boss, this tiny megalomaniacal tyrant, might fail to turn up.
 Erections were less wondrous works of the Almighty and more like cops: often
 there when you emphatically didn't require them and sometimes absent when
 you did. I once knew a woman who recounted a sexual episode with one of the
 totally famous studs of our time. "And how was it?" I inquired diffidently.

   "My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as
 a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by
 a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned
 men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer
 but as a fighter.
    In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage
 which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge
 to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific
 was his fight against the Jewish poison.
    Today, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more
 profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to
 shed his blood upon the Cross.
    As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have
 the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice...
    And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting
 rightly, it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have
 also a duty to my own people. And when I look on my people I see them work
 and work and toil and labor, and at the end of the week they have only
 for their wages wretchedness and misery.
    When I go out in the morning and see these men standing in their queues
 and look into their pinched faces, then I believe I would be no Christian,
 but a very devil, if I felt no pity for them, if I did not, as did our
 Lord two thousand years ago, turn against those by whom today this poor

"What is the easiest way for a skeptic to achieve faith? The question was
 answered three hundred years ago by Pascal. The unbeliever must act 'as
 though he believed, take holy water, have masses said etc. This will
 naturally cause you to believe and will besot you.' (Cela vous abetira--
 literally, will make you stupid.) We have to be made stupid, insist Professor
 Jacques Chevalier, defending his hero against the critics who have been
 shocked by Pascal's blunt language; we have to stultify our intelligence,
 because 'intellectual pride deprives us of God and debases us to the level of
 animals.' Which is, of course, perfectly true. But it does not follow from
 this truth that we ought to besot ourselves in the manner prescribed by
 Pascal and all the propagandists of all religions. Intellectual pride can
 be cured only by devaluating pretentious words, only by getting rid of
 conceptualized pseudo-knowledge and opening ourselves to reality. Artificial
 piety based on conditioned reflexes merely transfers intellectual pride from
 the bumptious individual to his even more bumptious Church. At one remove,
 the pride remains intact. For the convinced believer, understanding or direct
 contact with reality is exceedingly difficult. Moreover, the mere fact of
 having a strong reverential feeling about some hallowed thing, person or
 proposition is no guarantee of the existence of the thing, the infallibility
 of the person or truth of the proposition."

"There is but one way to demonstrate the existence of a power independent of
 and superior to nature, and that is by breaking, if only for one moment, the
 continuity of cause and effect. Pluck from the endless chain of existence one
 little link; stop for one instant the grand procession and you have shown
 beyond all contradiction that nature has a master. Change the fact, just for
 one second, that matter attracts matter, and a god appears.

     The rudest savage has always known this fact, and for that reason always
 demanded the evidence of miracle.  The founder of a religion must be able to
 turn water into wine -- cure with a word the blind and lame, and raise with a
 simple touch the dead to life. It was necessary for him to demonstrate to the
 satisfaction of his barbarian disciple, that he was superior to nature. In
 times of ignorance this was easy to do. The credulity of the savage was
 almost boundless. To him the marvelous was the beautiful, the mysterious was
 the sublime. Consequently, every religion has for its foundation a miracle --
 that is to say, a violation of nature -- that is to say, a falsehood.

     No one, in the world's whole history, ever attempted to substantiate a
 truth by a miracle. Truth scorns the assistance of miracle. Nothing but
 falsehood ever attested itself by signs and wonders. No miracle ever was
 performed, and no sane man ever thought he had performed one, and until one
 is performed, there can be no evidence of the existence of any power superior
 to, and independent of nature.

     The church wishes us to believe. Let the church, or one of its
 intellectual saints, perform a miracle, and we will believe. We are told

 man found that some of his religious conceptions were wrong. By reading his

"When I became convinced that the Universe is natural-that all the ghosts
 and gods are myths, there entered into my brain, into my soul, into every
 drop of my blood, the sense, the feeling, the joy of freedom.  The walls
 of my prison crumbled and fell, the dungeon was flooded with light and
 all the bolts, and bars, and manacles became dust. I was no longer a
 servant, a serf, or a slave. There was for me no master in all the wide
 world-not even in infinite space. I was free.
 -free to think, to express my thoughts
 -free to live to my own ideal
 -free to live for myself and those I loved
 -free to use all my faculties, all my senses
 -free to spread imagination's wings
 -free to investigate, to guess and dream and hope
 -free to judge and determine for myself
 -free to reject all ignorant and cruel creeds, all the "inspired" books
  that savages have produced, and all the barbarous legends of the past
 -free from popes and priests
 -free from all the "called" and "set apart"
 -free from sanctified mistakes and holy lies
 -free from the fear of eternal pain
 -free from the winged monsters of night
 -free from devils, ghosts, and gods
   For the first time I was free. There were no prohibited places in all
 the realms of my thought-no air, no space, where fancy could not spread
 her painted wings
 -no chains for my limbs
 -no lashes for my back
 -no fires for my flesh
 -no master's frown or threat
 -no following another's steps
 -no need to bow, or cringe, or crawl, or utter lying words.
   I was free. I stood erect and fearlessly, joyously, faced all worlds.
 And then my heart was filled with gratitude, with thankfulness, and
 went out in love to all the heroes, the thinkers who gave their lives
 for the liberty of hand and brain
 -for the freedom of labor and thought
 -to those who fell on the fierce fields of war, to those who died in
  dungeons bound with chains
 -to those who proudly mounted scaffold's stairs
 -to those whose bones were crushed, whose flesh was scarred and torn
 -to those by fire consumed
 -to all the wise, the good, the brave of every land, whose thoughts and
  deeds have given freedom to the sons of men.
   And I vowed to grasp the torch that they had held, and hold it high,
 that light might conquer darkness still."

 one who thinks he can gain happiness in another world, by raising hell with

 Being of infinite wisdom and goodness, and yet believes that that being has

"No human being has imagination enough to conceive of this infinite horror.

 All that the human race has suffered in war and want, in pestilence and
 famine, in fire and flood -- all the pangs and pains of every disease and
 every death -- all of this is nothing compared with the agonies to be
 endured by one lost soul.

 This is the consolation of the Christian religion. This is the justice
 of God -- the mercy of Christ.

 This frightful dogma, this infinite lie, made me the implacable enemy of
 Christianity. The truth is that this belief in eternal pain has been the real
 persecutor. It founded the Inquisition, forged the chains, and furnished the
 fagots. It has darkened the lives of many millions. It made the cradle as
 terrible as the coffin. It enslaved nations and shed the blood of countless
 thousands. It sacrificed the wisest, the bravest and the best. It subverted
 the idea of justice, drove mercy from the heart, changed men to fiends and
 banished reason from the brain.

 Like a venomous serpent it crawls and coils and hisses in every orthodox
 creed.

 It makes man an eternal victim and God an eternal fiend. It is the one
 infinite horror. Every church in which it is taught is a public curse. Every
 preacher who teaches it is an enemy of mankind. Below this Christian dogma,
 savagery cannot go. It is the infinite of malice, hatred, and revenge.

 Nothing could add to the horror of hell, except the presence of its
 creator, God.

 While I have life, as long as I draw breath, I shall deny with all my
 strength, and hate with every drop of my blood, this infinite lie."

"Christianity teaches that all offences can be forgiven. Every church
 unconsciously allows people to commit crimes on credit. On the other hand,
 what is called infidelity says: There is no being in the universe who rewards,
 and there is no being who punishes -- every act has its consequences. If the
 act is good, the consequences are good; if the act is bad, the consequences
 are bad; and these consequences must be borne by the actor. It says to every
 human being: You must reap what you sow. There is no reward, there is no
 punishment, but there are consequences, and these consequences are the
 invisible and implacable police of nature. They cannot be avoided. They
 cannot be bribed. No power can awe them, and there is not gold enough in the
 world to make them pause. Even a God cannot induce them to release for one
 instant their victim.

 This great truth is, in my judgment, the gospel of morality. If all men knew
 that they must inevitably bear the consequences of their own actions -- if
 they absolutely knew that they could not injure another without injuring
 themselves, the world, in my judgment, would be far better than it is."

"Rome was far better when Pagan than when Catholic. It was better to allow
 gladiators and criminals to fight than to burn honest men. The greatest of
 the Romans denounced the cruelties of the arena. Seneca condemned the combats
 even of wild beasts. He was tender enough to say that "we should have a bond
 of sympathy for all sentient beings, knowing that only the depraved and base
 take pleasure in the sight of blood and suffering." Aurelius compelled the
 gladiators to fight with blunted swords. Roman lawyers declared that all men
 are by nature free and equal. Woman, under Pagan rule in Rome, became as free
 as man. Zeno, long before the birth of Christ, taught that virtue alone
 establishes a difference between men. We know that the Civil Law is the
 foundation of our codes. We know that fragments of Greek and Roman art --
 a few manuscripts saved from Christian destruction, some inventions and
 discoveries of the Moors -- were the seeds of modern civilization.
 Christianity, for a thousand years, taught memory to forget and reason to
 believe. Not one step was taken in advance. Over the manuscripts of
 philosophers and poets, priests with their ignorant tongues thrust out,
 devoutly scrawled the forgeries of faith. For a thousand years the torch of
 progress was extinguished in the blood of Christ, and his disciples, moved
 by ignorant zeal, by insane, cruel creeds, destroyed with flame and sword a
 hundred million of their fellow-men. They made this world a hell. But if
 cathedrals had been universities -- if dungeons of the Inquisition had been

"Science is the enemy of fear and credulity. It invites investigation,
 challenges the reason, stimulates inquiry, and welcomes the unbeliever. It
 seeks to give food and shelter, and raiment, education and liberty to the
 human race. It welcomes every fact and every truth. It has furnished a
 foundation of morals, a philosophy for the guidance of man. From all books
 it selects the good, and from all theories, the true. It seeks to civilize
 the human race by the cultivation of the intellect and heart. It refines,
 through art, music and the drama -- giving voice and expression to every
 noble thought. The mysterious does not excite the feeling of worship, but
 the ambition to understand. It does not pray -- it works. It does not answer
 inquiry with the malicious cry of "blasphemy." Its feelings are not hurt by
 contradiction, neither does it ask to be protected by law from the laughter
 of heretics. It has taught man that he cannot walk beyond the horizon -- that
 the questions of origin and destiny cannot be answered -- they an infinite
 personality cannot be comprehended by a finite being, and that the truth of
 any system of religion based on the supernatural cannot by any possibility
 be established -- such a religion not being within the domain of evidence.

 is by no means certain that he is the author of the Bible. Why then should
 we not place greater confidence in Nature than in a book? And even if this
 God made not only the world but the book besides, it does not follow that
 the book is the best part of creation, and the only part that we will be
 eternally punished for denying. It seems to me that it is quite as important
 to know something of the solar system, something of the physical history of
 this globe, as it is to know the adventures of Jonah or the diet of Ezekiel.
 For my part, I would infinitely prefer to know all the results of scientific

 for priests to deny the doctrine of evolution, or the dynamic theory of heat?
 Why should we be damned for laughing at Samson and his foxes, while others,

 seems to me that a belief in the great truths of science are fully as
 essential to salvation, as the creed of any church. We are taught that a man
 may be perfectly acceptable to God even if he denies the rotundity of the
 earth, the Copernican system, the three laws of Kepler, the indestructibility

"We have already compared the benefits of theology and science. When the
 theologian governed the world, it was covered with huts and hovels for the
 many, palaces and cathedrals for the few. To nearly all the children of men,
 reading and writing were unknown arts. The poor were clad in rags and skins
 -- they devoured crusts, and gnawed bones. The day of Science dawned, and
 the luxuries of a century ago are the necessities of to-day. Men in the
 middle ranks of life have more of the conveniences and elegancies than the
 princes and kings of the theological times. But above and over all this, is
 the development of mind. There is more of value in the brain of an average
 man of to-day -- of a master-mechanic, of a chemist, of a naturalist, of an
 inventor, than there was in the brain of the world four hundred years ago.

 These blessings did not fall from the skies. These benefits did not drop
 from the outstretched hands of priests. They were not found in cathedrals or
 behind altars -- neither were they searched for with holy candles. They were
 not discovered by the closed eyes of prayer, nor did they come in answer to
 superstitious supplication. They are the children of freedom, the gifts of
 reason, observation and experience -and for them all, man is indebted to man."

 take every form of propagation of religion out of the realm of things
 which could directly or indirectly be made public business, and thereby be
 supported in whole or in part at taxpayers' expense. That is a difference
 which the Constitution sets up between religion and almost every other
 subject matter of legislation, a difference which goes to the very root of
 religious freedom[...] This freedom was first in the Bill of Rights because
 it was first in the forefathers' minds; it was set forth in absolute terms,
 and its strength is its rigidity. It was intended not only to keep the
 states' hands out of religion, but to keep religion's hands off the state,
 and, above all, to keep bitter religious controversy out of public life by
 denying to every denomination any advantage from getting control of public
 policy or the public purse."

"[The Establishment Clause and Religious Freedom Clause] of our Federal
 Constitution ha[ve] never been wholly pleasing to most religious groups.
 They are all quick to invoke its protections; they are all irked when they
 feel its restraints. This Court has gone a long way, if not an unreasonable
 way, to hold that public business of paramount importance as maintenance of
 public order, protection of the privacy of a home, and taxation may not be
 pursued by a state in a way that even indirectly will interfere with
 religious proselyting.[...]  But we cannot have it both ways.  Religious
 teaching cannot be a private affair when the state seeks to impose
 regulations which infringe on it indirectly, and a public affair when it
 comes to taxing citizens of one faith to aid another, or those of no faith
 to aid all. If these principles seem harsh in prohibiting aid to Catholic
 education, it must not be forgotten that it is the same Constitution that
 alone assures Catholics the right to maintain these schools at all when
 predominant local sentiment would forbid them. [...] Nor should I think
 that those who have done so well without this aid would want to see this
 separation between Church and State broken down.  If the state may aid
 these religious schools, it may therefore regulate them. Many groups have
 sought aid from tax funds, only to find that it carried political controls
 with it. Indeed, this Court has declared that 'It is hardly lack of due
 process for the Government to regulate that which it subsidizes.'

"Human beings cannot be morally responsible to God. If we blame a person for
 an evil act, we thereby imply that he was to some extent evil prior to his
 action. For to say that a person is responsible for an evil action is to say
 he caused it because he was evil. But how did he become evil? It he made
 himself evil, then this would be an evil act and would--if he were responsible
 for it--imply that he was already evil. It follows that the evil of a person
 must precede the act of making himself evil. Therefore this individual cannot
 ultimately be the responsible source of his own evil. Then who is? It cannot
 be Satan, for the same argument would apply to him. It must be God, for he
 created everything. Therefore God is ultimately responsible for all evil."

"It is sometimes argued that we have a fifty-fifty betting proposition when
 considering God's existence or nonexistence. If we bet that God exists and
 he does exist, then we lose nothing while possibly gaining salvation. If we
 bet that God exist and he does not exist, then we lose nothing. But if we
 bet that God does not exist and he does exist, then we lose everything. Of
 course, if we bet that God does not exist and we are correct, then we lose
 nothing. Therefore it is prudent to bet on God. (This is Pascal`s Wager).
    The problem with the above argument is that it does not establish a
 fifty-fifty betting proposition. There are many alternatives that it fails
 to consider. For example, God may exist but he may damn anyone who "bets" on
 his existence merely for reasons of prudence. He may consider such a "bet"
 to be an insult. Furthermore, it may be that a mere belief in God is not
 enough to ensure salvation. A further requirement may be the belief in a
 particular religion. But which religion? Again, there are many alternatives.
 Another possible alternative is that God offers salvation only to atheist
 because God does not like being surrounded by obsequious "yes-men." God may
 prize independence and skepticism."
