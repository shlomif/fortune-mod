"Not once in this century of terror has mankind risen above the Titans. Their every craven, bloodthirsty advance has left a wake of inestimable loss for us. Lives taken, territory abandoned. However, should we succeed, we'll make history. Today is the day lands taken by our greatest enemy will be reclaimed. For the first time, we will know what it means not to run, but to meet the Titans head-on and win! Now, it may seem an insignificant lot of land compared to the vast tracts of former glory long abandoned, but as a symbol, as an idea, Trost's regain shall stand as a reclamation of pride and hope beyond measure. A leap greater than we have ever taken!"

"I've been here too long for my own good. Three years of this madness, surrounded by idiots. We were kids! What did we know about anything? Why did there have to be people like this? Why? Why did I let myself devolve into such a half-assed piece of shit?! It's too late now... (begins removing Historia's sling from his injured arm) Damned if I know what's right anymore. Who cares, it is what it is. But the only choice left for me now. (holds up now steaming arm) As a Warrior... no road left but the one that leads to the end!"

"Whoa, whoa, hold on, Historia. Have ya forgotten what your dear old dad did to ya? Ya were born in the first place out of someone else's misery. Because this man disregarded his place in the world just so he could feel good with a house servant... Your mother had ya because she thought, if things went well, maybe she could be the master's wife. But your existence was a disgrace to his subjects and the Assembly! Everyone wished ya'd never been born, includin' your daddy here! But then, the unthinkable! Those pedigreed brats of his went off to meet their maker, all in one night! And, whaddaya know, this nice old fella comes strollin' up to ya! The Assembly ordered us in the Interior Squad to cleanse the stain on the Royal Honour by makin' the whore this man slept with disappear, along with her kid. But he decided to protect you, and just you. He saved your life by coverin' up your birth and sendin' ya to the military. Only the Wallists knew to keep an eye on ya. Why was that? 'Cause his paternal instincts finally kicked in and he decided to start lovin' his daughter? Beep! Wrong!! HE JUST NEEDED YOUR BLOOD!! Not only that, this piece of shit doesn't want to turn into a Titan himself, so he keeps orderin' his brother and daughter to do it!! I got more! He even tried to hide the fact that Freida and his brats were dead and the Power of the Titans had been stolen! All 'cause he was scared that, without that power, the Reiss family wouldn't be at THE CENTRE OF THE UNIVERSE anymore!! He only started spittin' out some details when Eren used his Titan to take back Trost District!! D'ya know how much we lost in those years?! How many precious lives?! O'COURSE HE DON'T GIVE TWO SHITS ABOUT ANY OF IT! NOT HIS FAMILY! NOT HUMANITY! AND CERTAINLY NOT YOU, HISTORIA!! ALL HE CARES ABOUT IS PROTECTIN' HIMSELF!! SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF YOUR FATHER NOW?!

"... Never needed to happen... Me... My father... If he hadn't done what he did here five years ago... Your sister would have been able to take care of everything, right? Because he stole the Power of the Titans from its rightful place... So many people died... Armin's grandpa... Thomas... Mina... Mylius... Nac... Marco... Everyone in Squad Levi... The residents of Stohess District... The soldiers who tried to rescue me... Mister Hannes... And so many more I don't even know... I... I could never atone for all that... It never needed to happen. All of those days we spent training. All those dreams about what could be... past the Walls. I... never needed to happen. ... Do it. At the very least... let it end at your hand. Historia... eat me... And save humanity. It's all... up to you."

"We're born free. All of us. Free. Some don't believe it, some try to take it away. To hell with them! Water like fire, mountains of ice, the whole bit. Lay your eyes on that, and you'll know what freedom is, that it's worth fighting for! Fight to live, risk it all for even a glimmer of real freedom! It doesn't matter what's waiting outside the gate, or what comes in! It doesn't matter how cruel the world can be, or how unjust! Fight. Fight. Fight. FIGHT! FIGHT!!!"
