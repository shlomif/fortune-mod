"Christa... I felt the same. That it would have been better if I was never born at all. The world hated me just for existing. To give countless joy to many people, I gave up my life. But - when I did, I wished from the bottom of my heart. If someday I was given a second chance at life... This time. I would live for no one but myself!"

"The first King Reiss, the man who created this walled land. Wished for a world where humanity was ruled by the Titans. The First King believed that was the path to true peace. ... I don't know why. It's only known to those who see the memories of the World. I learned that first-hand. My father acted the same way when he inherited the First King's Ideology. Both my brother and I pleaded with him to free humanity from the Titans... We begged him again and again. But he did not grant our wish. Nor would he ever reveal why. Eventually, the day came when our father had to entrust his role to a son. My younger brother volunteered himself, but he gave me a mission of my own in exchange. He said he wanted me to pray. When I saw my brother's eyes after he had inherited the Power of the Titans... I understood what he meant. My brother had become the sole creator of this World. And its ultimate governing force. An all-knowing, all-powerful being. Do you know what we call that? God. Our word for that... is God. There is meaning in every catastrophe. Whether humanity is destined to perish or survive... That decision is in God's hands. My duty is to summon God back into this World and offer my prayers to her. I'm praying, Historia... For God to guide Humanity."
