Quick and Dirty Compilation
---------------------------

fortune-mod is using CMake ( http://www.cmake.org/ )
for its build system. You'll need to install CMake version 3.0
or later from your distribution's repository or from its source
distribution. *NOTE*: CMake 2.6.2 (that ships with some releases of Ubuntu)
won't work due to a regression bug so please don't report any errors with
it.

Next, run:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake-gui ..         # For the GUI configuration applet

Or:

    ccmake ..            # For the Curses-based configuration applet

With a fallback to:

    cmake ..             # Non-interactive application.

This will build and install all the executables and install the fortune
collections.

Installing under Win32
----------------------

Consult the CMake documentation for generating a Visual C++ , MinGW32
etc. compatible makefile or project. It may only work under cygwin or similar
environment.

Testing
-------

To test the Black Hole Solitaire Solver, you need to:

1. Configure it.

2. Build it.

3. Run "make check".
