Quick and Dirty Compilation
---------------------------

fortune-mod uses CMake ( http://www.cmake.org/ )
for its build system. Version 3 or later is required.

You will also need librecode.

Next, run:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake-gui ..         # For the GUI configuration applet

Or:

    ccmake ..            # For the Curses-based configuration applet

With a fallback to:

    cmake ..             # Non-interactive application.

This will build and install all the executables and install the fortune
collections.

Installing under Win32
----------------------

Consult the CMake documentation for generating a Visual C++ , MinGW32
etc. compatible makefile or project. It may only work under cygwin or similar
environment.

Testing
-------

The tests require the File::Find::Object Perl module
(libfile-find-object-perl in Debian and derivatives), Test::Differences
(libtest-differences-perl) and Test::RunValgrind (from CPAN).

To test fortune-mod, you need to:

1. Configure it.

2. Build it.

3. Run "make check".
