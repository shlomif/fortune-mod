/*
 * The following code has been derived chiefly from the BSD distributions
 * of the utility program unstr and the random quote displayer fortune.
 * The utility produced by this code shares characteristics of both
 * (it might be regarded as a minimalist implementation of fortune, for
 * large values of 'minimal'), and is here offered so as to have the
 * minimal necessary tools for rabbiting a strfile routine into some other,
 * more significant program, all in one place.  A programmer who cares and
 * has the proper training could probably clean this up significantly; it's
 * all stolen code (first rule of programming: steal) hacked together to
 * fit.  Or, to paraphrase the old saw about how the British built ships,
 * it's coded by the mile and cut off to order.  In that analogy, this
 * program's about an inch--and separated with an axe.
 *
 * Axe murderess programming.  Wotta concept!
 *
 * Use at your own peril, especially as a pattern (kludge, kludge!). This
 * program, at least, shouldn't have any real chance of corrupting data,
 * though; it opens files ro and dumps to the screen.  If you redirect
 * output, you definitely do so at your own peril (I lost six hours of
 * editing on a fortune file that way, by redirecting the output of unstr
 * before it had an outputfile option, trying to skip over the mv x.sorted
 * x step.  Axe murderess redirection, in that case).

/* randstr repeats the minimum functionality of the fortune program.  It
 * finds the fortune text or data file specified on the command line --
 * one or the other, not both -- generates a random number, and displays
 * the text string indexed.  No provision is made for any other command
 * line switches.  At all.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * randstr filename[.ext]
 *
 * Example: run sed or Perl over your /etc/passwd, and kick out a
 * strfile-format file containing lognames on the first line and full
 * names on the second.  Write a script called 'lottery' which is
 * called once a month from crontab; it in turn calls randstr lusers,
 * and the winning luser gets a prize notification sent by email from
 * the lottery script.  Living up to promises is optional.
 *
 * Note: if you're a sysadmin who regularly reads _Mein Kampf_ for the
 * deep truths buried in it, and believe in Truth, Justice, and the
 * American Family, you could use this to replace fortune, by pointing
 * it at a small, Family Values database.  The great advantage to this,
 * in my opinion, is that it wouldn't take up any disk space at all.
 * Who're you gonna quote?  Dan Quayle?
